Yet, such a semantic theory has little to say about any structures other than standard declarative sentences or about semantic aspects involved in conversation. It cannot explain the anomalies in sentences such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>?? <a class=\"hlink10\"> 1. Come there please!</a></li>\n\t<li>?? <a class=\"hlink10\"> 2. I hereby run to the station.</a></li>\n\t<li>?? <a class=\"hlink10\"> 3. I promise to punish you.</a></li>\n\t<li>?? <a class=\"hlink10\"> 4. The table is under the ash-tray.</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal of pragmaticsis therefore to define these and other non-truth functional aspects of meaning; hence, a more general approach towards meaning.</p>\n\n<p>Answers</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>1. Explanation: The adverb there is illegal in this context, rather, it should be: come here please, i.e. from an external position to the position of the interlocutor.</li>\n\t<li>2. Explanation: The adverbial hereby requires a so-called performative verb, i.e. a verb that performs a certain action, such as promise, declare, etc.</li>\n\t<li>3. The term &#39;promise&#39; normally involves that the addressee wants the promise to be realized. Is that the case with punishing someone?</li>\n\t<li>4. Explanation: Small objects are mentioned first if they are related to larger objects. Thus, The table is under the ash-tray is only acceptable if the ash-tray is at least as big as the table.</li>\n</ul>\n"

Thus, we need to make a distinction between the usual meaning of a word or a sentence and the meaning it has in specific circumstances; i.e. we need to differentiate between meaning and use. Here is an example:</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"hlink10\"> It&#39;s fairly hot in here!</a></p>\n\n<p>The dichotomy between semantics (meaning) and pragmatics (use) is controversial among linguists. Perhaps the most useful distinction is made in terms of sentence meaning vs. utterance meaning where the latter includes all secondary aspects of meaning.</p>\n"

Austin</a> pointed out that a large number of utterances are part of an action; they are performative:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"font10\">\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> I hereby name this ship H.M.S. Titanic.</a></li>\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> There is a dog in the field!</a></li>\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> Don&#39;t do that!</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"font10\">The peculiar thing about these sentences is that they are not used to state things, i.e. they are not just constative, but rather actively do things. Furthermore, such utterances cannot be assessed as true or false but as appropriate or inappropriate. How this is done has been manifested in <a class=\"link10\"  \"https://linguistics.online.uni-marburg.de/secure/generalmodules/semantics/pragmatics_overview/virtualsession/vslessons/speech_acts_1.html\">speech act theory</a>.</p>\n"

One is the<a class=\"link10\" \"https://linguistics.online.uni-marburg.de/secure/generalmodules/semantics/pragmatics_overview/virtualsession/vslessons/speech_acts_2.html\"> systematization of speech acts </a>by <a class=\"hlink10\"> John Searle</a>.</p>\n"

He seeks more abstract schemes based on a new typology of actions that can be performed in speaking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> representatives</a></li>\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> directives</a></li>\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> commissives</a></li>\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> expressives</a></li>\n\t<li><a class=\"hlink10\"> declarations</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Further extensions concern a more precise definition of the locutionary act and the formulation of rules and conditions to differentiate illocutionary acts from one another.</p>\n"
