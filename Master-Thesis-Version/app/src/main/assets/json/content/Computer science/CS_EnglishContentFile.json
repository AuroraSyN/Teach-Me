            "<h2>C++ Overview</h2>\n\n<p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</p>\n\n<p>C++ is regarded as a <b>middle-level</b> language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.</p>\n\n<p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>\n\n<p>C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note</b> &minus; A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed during compile-time as opposed to run-time.</p>\n\n<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>\n\n<p>C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Encapsulation</li>\n\t<li>Data hiding</li>\n\t<li>Inheritance</li>\n\t<li>Polymorphism</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Standard Libraries</h2>\n\n<p>Standard C++ consists of three important parts &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The ANSI Standard</h2>\n\n<p>The ANSI standard is an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable; that code you write for Microsoft&#39;s compiler will compile without errors, using a compiler on a Mac, UNIX, a Windows box, or an Alpha.</p>\n\n<p>The ANSI standard has been stable for a while, and all the major C++ compiler manufacturers support the ANSI standard.</p>\n\n<h2>Learning C++</h2>\n\n<p>The most important thing while learning C++ is to focus on concepts.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of learning a programming language is to become a better programmer; that is, to become more effective at designing and implementing new systems and at maintaining old ones.</p>\n\n<p>C++ supports a variety of programming styles. You can write in the style of Fortran, C, Smalltalk, etc., in any language. Each style can achieve its aims effectively while maintaining runtime and space efficiency.</p>\n\n<h2>Use of C++</h2>\n\n<p>C++ is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers in essentially every application domain.</p>\n\n<p>C++ is being highly used to write device drivers and other software that rely on direct manipulation of hardware under realtime constraints.</p>\n\n<p>C++ is widely used for teaching and research because it is clean enough for successful teaching of basic concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone who has used either an Apple Macintosh or a PC running Windows has indirectly used C++ because the primary user interfaces of these systems are written in C++.</p>\n"

Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.</p>\n\n<p>Name and version of text editor can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as Linux, or UNIX.</p>\n\n<p>The files you create with your editor are called source files and for C++ they typically are named with the extension .cpp, .cp, or .c.</p>\n\n<p>A text editor should be in place to start your C++ programming.</p>\n\n<h3>C++ Compiler</h3>\n\n<p>This is an actual C++ compiler, which will be used to compile your source code into final executable program.</p>\n\n<p>Most C++ compilers don&#39;t care what extension you give to your source code, but if you don&#39;t specify otherwise, many will use .cpp by default.</p>\n\n<p>Most frequently used and free available compiler is GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective Operating Systems.</p>\n\n<h2>Installing GNU C/C++ Compiler</h2>\n\n<h3>UNIX/Linux Installation</h3>\n\n<p>If you are using <b>Linux or UNIX</b> then check whether GCC is installed on your system by entering the following command from the command line &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n$ g++ -v\n</pre>\n\n<p>If you have installed GCC, then it should print a message such as the following &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nUsing built-in specs.\nTarget: i386-redhat-linux\nConfigured with: ../configure --prefix=/usr .......\nThread model: posix\ngcc version 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-46)\n</pre>\n\n<p>If GCC is not installed, then you will have to install it yourself using the detailed instructions available at <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/install/\" target=\"_blank\">https://gcc.gnu.org/install/</a></p>\n\n<h3>Mac OS X Installation</h3>\n\n<p>If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to obtain GCC is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple&#39;s website and follow the simple installation instructions.</p>\n\n<p>Xcode is currently available at <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/\" target=\"_blank\">developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Windows Installation</h3>\n\n<p>To install GCC at Windows you need to install MinGW. To install MinGW, go to the MinGW homepage, <a href=\"http://www.mingw.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.mingw.org</a>, and follow the link to the MinGW download page. Download the latest version of the MinGW installation program which should be named MinGW-&lt;version&gt;.exe.</p>\n\n<p>While installing MinGW, at a minimum, you must install gcc-core, gcc-g++, binutils, and the MinGW runtime, but you may wish to install more.</p>\n\n<p>Add the bin subdirectory of your MinGW installation to your <b>PATH</b> environment variable so that you can specify these tools on the command line by their simple names.</p>\n\n<p>When the installation is complete, you will be able to run gcc, g++, ar, ranlib, dlltool, and several other GNU tools from the Windows command line.</p>\n\n<hr />"

            "<h2>C++ Basic Syntax</h2>\n\n<p>When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other&#39;s methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Object</b> &minus; Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Class</b> &minus; A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Methods</b> &minus; A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Instance Variables</b> &minus; Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object&#39;s state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>C++ Program Structure</h2>\n\n<p>Let us look at a simple code that would print the words <i>Hello World</i>.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\" href=\"http://tpcg.io/n4BVuS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Live Demo</a></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"com\">#include</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">using</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">namespace</span><span class=\"pln\"> std</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n</span><span class=\"com\">// main() is where program execution begins.</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> main</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   cout </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"com\">// prints Hello World</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<p>Let us look at the various parts of the above program &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <b>&lt;iostream&gt;</b> is needed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The line <b>using namespace std;</b> tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The next line &#39;<b>// main() is where program execution begins.</b>&#39; is a single-line comment available in C++. Single-line comments begin with // and stop at the end of the line.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The line <b>int main()</b> is the main function where program execution begins.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The next line <b>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot;;</b> causes the message &quot;Hello World&quot; to be displayed on the screen.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The next line <b>return 0;</b> terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Compile and Execute C++ Program</h2>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s look at how to save the file, compile and run the program. Please follow the steps given below &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Open a text editor and add the code as above.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Save the file as: hello.cpp</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you saved the file.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Type &#39;g++ hello.cpp&#39; and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate a.out executable file.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Now, type &#39;a.out&#39; to run your program.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You will be able to see &#39; Hello World &#39; printed on the window.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n$ g++ hello.cpp\n$ ./a.out\nHello World\n</pre>\n\n<p>Make sure that g++ is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing file hello.cpp.</p>\n\n<p>You can compile C/C++ programs using makefile. For more details, you can check our <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/makefile/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">&#39;Makefile Tutorial&#39;</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Semicolons and Blocks in C++</h2>\n\n<p>In C++, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.</p>\n\n<p>For example, following are three different statements &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nx = y;\ny = y + 1;\nadd(x, y);\n</pre>\n\n<p>A block is a set of logically connected statements that are surrounded by opening and closing braces. For example &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n{\n   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot;; // prints Hello World\n   return 0;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>C++ does not recognize the end of the line as a terminator. For this reason, it does not matter where you put a statement in a line. For example &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nx = y;\ny = y + 1;\nadd(x, y);\n</pre>\n\n<p>is the same as</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nx = y; y = y + 1; add(x, y);\n</pre>\n\n<h2>C++ Identifiers</h2>\n\n<p>A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>\n\n<p>C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, <b>Manpower</b> and <b>manpower</b> are two different identifiers in C++.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nmohd       zara    abc   move_name  a_123\nmyname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal\n</pre>\n\n<h2>C++ Keywords</h2>\n\n<p>The following list shows the reserved words in C++. These reserved words may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>asm</td>\n\t\t\t<td>else</td>\n\t\t\t<td>new</td>\n\t\t\t<td>this</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>auto</td>\n\t\t\t<td>enum</td>\n\t\t\t<td>operator</td>\n\t\t\t<td>throw</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>bool</td>\n\t\t\t<td>explicit</td>\n\t\t\t<td>private</td>\n\t\t\t<td>true</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>break</td>\n\t\t\t<td>export</td>\n\t\t\t<td>protected</td>\n\t\t\t<td>try</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>case</td>\n\t\t\t<td>extern</td>\n\t\t\t<td>public</td>\n\t\t\t<td>typedef</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>catch</td>\n\t\t\t<td>false</td>\n\t\t\t<td>register</td>\n\t\t\t<td>typeid</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>char</td>\n\t\t\t<td>float</td>\n\t\t\t<td>reinterpret_cast</td>\n\t\t\t<td>typename</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>class</td>\n\t\t\t<td>for</td>\n\t\t\t<td>return</td>\n\t\t\t<td>union</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>const</td>\n\t\t\t<td>friend</td>\n\t\t\t<td>short</td>\n\t\t\t<td>unsigned</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>const_cast</td>\n\t\t\t<td>goto</td>\n\t\t\t<td>signed</td>\n\t\t\t<td>using</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>continue</td>\n\t\t\t<td>if</td>\n\t\t\t<td>sizeof</td>\n\t\t\t<td>virtual</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>default</td>\n\t\t\t<td>inline</td>\n\t\t\t<td>static</td>\n\t\t\t<td>void</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>delete</td>\n\t\t\t<td>int</td>\n\t\t\t<td>static_cast</td>\n\t\t\t<td>volatile</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>do</td>\n\t\t\t<td>long</td>\n\t\t\t<td>struct</td>\n\t\t\t<td>wchar_t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>double</td>\n\t\t\t<td>mutable</td>\n\t\t\t<td>switch</td>\n\t\t\t<td>while</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>dynamic_cast</td>\n\t\t\t<td>namespace</td>\n\t\t\t<td>template</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&nbsp;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Trigraphs</h2>\n\n<p>A few characters have an alternative representation, called a trigraph sequence.

Each variable in C++ has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable&#39;s memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.</p>\n\n<p>The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C++ is case-sensitive &minus;</p>\n\n<p>There are following basic types of variable in C++ as explained in last chapter &minus;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:5%\">Sr.No</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Type &amp; Description</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"ts\">1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>bool</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Stores either value true or false.</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td class=\"ts\">2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>char</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Typically a single octet (one byte).

A variable definition specifies a data type, and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ntype variable_list;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here, <b>type</b> must be a valid C++ data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool or any user-defined object, etc., and <b>variable_list</b> may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nint    i, j, k;\nchar   c, ch;\nfloat  f, salary;\ndouble d;\n</pre>\n\n<p>The line <b>int i, j, k;</b> both declares and defines the variables i, j and k; which instructs the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.</p>\n\n<p>Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ntype variable_name = value;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Some examples are &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nextern int d = 3, f = 5;    // declaration of d and f. \nint d = 3, f = 5;           // definition and initializing d and f. \nbyte z = 22;                // definition and initializes z. \nchar x = &#39;x&#39;;               // the variable x has the value &#39;x&#39;.\n</pre>\n\n<p>For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables is undefined.</p>\n\n<h2>Variable Declaration in C++</h2>\n\n<p>A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing with the given type and name so that compiler proceed for further compilation without needing complete detail about the variable. A variable declaration has its meaning at the time of compilation only, compiler needs actual variable definition at the time of linking of the program.</p>\n\n<p>A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will use <b>extern</b> keyword to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable multiple times in your C++ program, but it can be defined only once in a file, a function or a block of code.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Try the following example where a variable has been declared at the top, but it has been defined inside the main function &minus;</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\" href=\"http://tpcg.io/odXXRO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Live Demo</a></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"com\">#include</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">using</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">namespace</span><span class=\"pln\"> std</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n</span><span class=\"com\">// Variable declaration:</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">extern</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> a</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> b</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">extern</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> c</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">extern</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">float</span><span class=\"pln\"> f</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n  \n</span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> main </span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"com\">// Variable definition:</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> a</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> b</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> c</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">float</span><span class=\"pln\"> f</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n \n   </span><span class=\"com\">// actual initialization</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   a </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">10</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   b </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">20</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   c </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> a </span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"pln\"> b</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n \n   cout </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> c </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> endl </span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   f </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">70.0</span><span class=\"pun\">/</span><span class=\"lit\">3.0</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   cout </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> f </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> endl </span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n \n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n30\n23.3333\n</pre>\n\n<p>Same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else.

            "<h2>Storage Classes in C++</h2>\n\n<p>A storage class defines the scope (visibility) and life-time of variables and/or functions within a C++ Program. These specifiers precede the type that they modify. There are following storage classes, which can be used in a C++ Program</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>auto</li>\n\t<li>register</li>\n\t<li>static</li>\n\t<li>extern</li>\n\t<li>mutable</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The auto Storage Class</h2>\n\n<p>The <b>auto</b> storage class is the default storage class for all local variables.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n{\n   int mount;\n   auto int month;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>The example above defines two variables with the same storage class, auto can only be used within functions, i.e., local variables.</p>\n\n<h2>The register Storage Class</h2>\n\n<p>The <b>register</b> storage class is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM. This means that the variable has a maximum size equal to the register size (usually one word) and can&#39;t have the unary &#39;&amp;&#39; operator applied to it (as it does not have a memory location).</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n{\n   register int  miles;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>The register should only be used for variables that require quick access such as counters. It should also be noted that defining &#39;register&#39; does not mean that the variable will be stored in a register. It means that it MIGHT be stored in a register depending on hardware and implementation restrictions.</p>\n\n<h2>The static Storage Class</h2>\n\n<p>The <b>static</b> storage class instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life-time of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and goes out of scope. Therefore, making local variables static allows them to maintain their values between function calls.</p>\n\n<p>The static modifier may also be applied to global variables. When this is done, it causes that variable&#39;s scope to be restricted to the file in which it is declared.</p>\n\n<p>In C++, when static is used on a class data member, it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all objects of its class.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\" href=\"http://tpcg.io/20HjiV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Live Demo</a></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"com\">#include</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n \n</span><span class=\"com\">// Function declaration</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> func</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pun\">);</span><span class=\"pln\">\n \n</span><span class=\"kwd\">static</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> count </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">10</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"com\">/* Global variable */</span><span class=\"pln\">\n \nmain</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\">count</span><span class=\"pun\">--)</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      func</span><span class=\"pun\">();</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n</span><span class=\"com\">// Function definition</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> func</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">static</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> i </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">5</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"com\">// local static variable</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   i</span><span class=\"pun\">++;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   std</span><span class=\"pun\">::</span><span class=\"pln\">cout </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&quot;i is &quot;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> i </span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   std</span><span class=\"pun\">::</span><span class=\"pln\">cout </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&quot; and count is &quot;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> count </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> std</span><span class=\"pun\">::</span><span class=\"pln\">endl</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ni is 6 and count is 9\ni is 7 and count is 8\ni is 8 and count is 7\ni is 9 and count is 6\ni is 10 and count is 5\ni is 11 and count is 4\ni is 12 and count is 3\ni is 13 and count is 2\ni is 14 and count is 1\ni is 15 and count is 0\n</pre>\n\n<h2>The extern Storage Class</h2>\n\n<p>The <b>extern</b> storage class is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files. When you use &#39;extern&#39; the variable cannot be initialized as all it does is point the variable name at a storage location that has been previously defined.</p>\n\n<p>When you have multiple files and you define a global variable or function, which will be used in other files also, then <i>extern</i> will be used in another file to give reference of defined variable or function. Just for understanding <i> extern </i> is used to declare a global variable or function in another file.</p>\n\n<p>The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions as explained below.</p>\n\n<h3>First File: main.cpp</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"com\">#include</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> count </span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">extern</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> write_extern</span><span class=\"pun\">();</span><span class=\"pln\">\n \nmain</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   count </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">5</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   write_extern</span><span class=\"pun\">();</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<h3>Second File: support.cpp</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nextern int count;\n\nvoid write_extern(void) {\n   std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Count is &quot; &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here, <i>extern</i> keyword is being used to declare count in another file.

It allows a member of an object to override const member function. That is, a mutable member can be modified by a const member function.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

            "<h2>C++ Functions</h2>\n\n<p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C++ program has at least one function, which is <b>main()</b>, and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.</p>\n\n<p>You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division usually is such that each function performs a specific task.</p>\n\n<p>A function <b>declaration</b> tells the compiler about a function&#39;s name, return type, and parameters. A function <b>definition</b> provides the actual body of the function.</p>\n\n<p>The C++ standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, function <b>strcat()</b> to concatenate two strings, function <b>memcpy()</b> to copy one memory location to another location and many more functions.</p>\n\n<p>A function is known with various names like a method or a sub-routine or a procedure etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Defining a Function</h2>\n\n<p>The general form of a C++ function definition is as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nreturn_type function_name( parameter list ) {\n   body of the function\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>A C++ function definition consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Return Type</b> &minus; A function may return a value. The <b>return_type</b> is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword <b>void</b>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Function Name</b> &minus; This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus; A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Function Body</b> &minus; The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>Following is the source code for a function called <b>max()</b>. This function takes two parameters num1 and num2 and return the biggest of both &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n// function returning the max between two numbers\n \nint max(int num1, int num2) {\n   // local variable declaration\n   int result;\n \n   if (num1 &gt; num2)\n      result = num1;\n   else\n      result = num2;\n \n   return result; \n}\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Function Declarations</h2>\n\n<p>A function <b>declaration</b> tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.</p>\n\n<p>A function declaration has the following parts &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nreturn_type function_name( parameter list );\n</pre>\n\n<p>For the above defined function max(), following is the function declaration &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nint max(int num1, int num2);\n</pre>\n\n<p>Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so following is also valid declaration &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nint max(int, int);\n</pre>\n\n<p>Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.</p>\n\n<h2>Calling a Function</h2>\n\n<p>While creating a C++ function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call or invoke that function.</p>\n\n<p>When a program calls a function, program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs defined task and when it&rsquo;s return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns program control back to the main program.</p>\n\n<p>To call a function, you simply need to pass the required parameters along with function name, and if function returns a value, then you can store returned value.

In general, this means that code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function and above mentioned example while calling max() function used the same method.</p>\n\n<h2>Default Values for Parameters</h2>\n\n<p>When you define a function, you can specify a default value for each of the last parameters.

            "<h2>C++ Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>C++ provides a data structure, <b>the array</b>, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.</p>\n\n<p>All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element.</p>\n\n<h2>Declaring Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>To declare an array in C++, the programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ntype arrayName [ arraySize ];\n</pre>\n\n<p>This is called a single-dimension array. The <b>arraySize</b> must be an integer constant greater than zero and <b>type</b> can be any valid C++ data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ndouble balance[10];\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Initializing Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>You can initialize C++ array elements either one by one or using a single statement as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ndouble balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 17.0, 50.0};\n</pre>\n\n<p>The number of values between braces { } can not be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ]. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array &minus;</p>\n\n<p>If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created.

Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ntype *var-name;\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here, <b>type</b> is the pointer&#39;s base type; it must be a valid C++ type and <b>var-name</b> is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk you used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk that you use for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Following are the valid pointer declaration &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nint    *ip;    // pointer to an integer\ndouble *dp;    // pointer to a double\nfloat  *fp;    // pointer to a float\nchar   *ch     // pointer to character\n</pre>\n\n<p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>\n\n<h2>Using Pointers in C++</h2>\n\n<p>There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very frequently. <b>(a)</b> We define a pointer variable. <b>(b)</b> Assign the address of a variable to a pointer. <b>(c)</b> Finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.

            "<h2>C++ Classes and Objects</h2>\n\n<p>The main purpose of C++ programming is to add object orientation to the C programming language and classes are the central feature of C++ that supports object-oriented programming and are often called user-defined types.</p>\n\n<p>A class is used to specify the form of an object and it combines data representation and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package. The data and functions within a class are called members of the class.</p>\n\n<h2>C++ Class Definitions</h2>\n\n<p>When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type. This doesn&#39;t actually define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, what an object of the class will consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object.</p>\n\n<p>A class definition starts with the keyword <b>class</b> followed by the class name; and the class body, enclosed by a pair of curly braces. A class definition must be followed either by a semicolon or a list of declarations. For example, we defined the Box data type using the keyword <b>class</b> as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nclass Box {\n   public:\n      double length;   // Length of a box\n      double breadth;  // Breadth of a box\n      double height;   // Height of a box\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p>The keyword <b>public</b> determines the access attributes of the members of the class that follows it. A public member can be accessed from outside the class anywhere within the scope of the class object. You can also specify the members of a class as <b>private</b> or <b>protected</b> which we will discuss in a sub-section.</p>\n\n<h2>Define C++ Objects</h2>\n\n<p>A class provides the blueprints for objects, so basically an object is created from a class. We declare objects of a class with exactly the same sort of declaration that we declare variables of basic types. Following statements declare two objects of class Box &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nBox Box1;          // Declare Box1 of type Box\nBox Box2;          // Declare Box2 of type Box\n</pre>\n\n<p>Both of the objects Box1 and Box2 will have their own copy of data members.</p>\n\n<h2>Accessing the Data Members</h2>\n\n<p>The public data members of objects of a class can be accessed using the direct member access operator (.). Let us try the following example to make the things clear &minus;</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\" href=\"http://tpcg.io/JeEWd6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Live Demo</a></p>\n\n<pre

            "<h2>C++ Inheritance</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most important concepts in object-oriented programming is that of inheritance. Inheritance allows us to define a class in terms of another class, which makes it easier to create and maintain an application. This also provides an opportunity to reuse the code functionality and fast implementation time.</p>\n\n<p>When creating a class, instead of writing completely new data members and member functions, the programmer can designate that the new class should inherit the members of an existing class. This existing class is called the <b>base</b> class, and the new class is referred to as the <b>derived</b> class.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of inheritance implements the <b>is a</b> relationship. For example, mammal IS-A animal, dog IS-A mammal hence dog IS-A animal as well and so on.</p>\n\n<h2>Base and Derived Classes</h2>\n\n<p>A class can be derived from more than one classes, which means it can inherit data and functions from multiple base classes. To define a derived class, we use a class derivation list to specify the base class(es). A class derivation list names one or more base classes and has the form &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nclass derived-class: access-specifier base-class\n</pre>\n\n<p>Where access-specifier is one of <b>public, protected,</b> or <b>private</b>, and base-class is the name of a previously defined class. If the access-specifier is not used, then it is private by default.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a base class <b>Shape</b> and its derived class <b>Rectangle</b> as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\"

The process of selecting the most appropriate overloaded function or operator is called <b>overload resolution</b>.</p>\n\n<h2>Function Overloading in C++</h2>\n\n<p>You can have multiple definitions for the same function name in the same scope.

is that the call of the function area() is being set once by the compiler as the version defined in the base class. This is called <b>static resolution</b> of the function call, or <b>static linkage</b> - the function call is fixed before the program is executed. This is also sometimes called <b>early binding</b> because the area() function is set during the compilation of the program.</p>\n\n<p>But now, let&#39;s make a slight modification in our program and precede the declaration of area() in the Shape class with the keyword <b>virtual</b> so that it looks like this &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nclass Shape {\n   protected:\n      int width, height;\n      \n   public:\n      Shape( int a = 0, int b = 0) {\n         width = a;\n         height = b;\n      }\n      virtual int area() {\n         cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Parent class area :&quot; &lt;&lt;endl;\n         return 0;\n      }\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p>After this slight modification, when the previous example code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nRectangle class area\nTriangle class area\n</pre>\n\n<p>This time, the compiler looks at the contents of the pointer instead of it&#39;s type. Hence, since addresses of objects of tri and rec classes are stored in *shape the respective area() function is called.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, each of the child classes has a separate implementation for the function area(). This is how <b>polymorphism</b> is generally used. You have different classes with a function of the same name, and even the same parameters, but with different implementations.</p>\n\n<h2>Virtual Function</h2>\n\n<p>A <b>virtual</b> function is a function in a base class that is declared using the keyword <b>virtual</b>. Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, signals to the compiler that we don&#39;t want static linkage for this function.</p>\n\n<p>What we do want is the selection of the function to be called at any given point in the program to be based on the kind of object for which it is called. This sort of operation is referred to as <b>dynamic linkage</b>, or <b>late binding</b>.</p>\n\n<h2>Pure Virtual Functions</h2>\n\n<p>It is possible that you want to include a virtual function in a base class so that it may be redefined in a derived class to suit the objects of that class, but that there is no meaningful definition you could give for the function in the base class.</p>\n\n<p>We can change the virtual function area() in the base class to the following &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nclass Shape {\n   protected:\n      int width, height;\n\n   public:\n      Shape(int a = 0, int b = 0) {\n         width = a;\n         height = b;\n      }\n      \n      // pure virtual function\n      virtual int area() = 0;\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p>The = 0 tells the compiler that the function has no body and above virtual function will be called <b>pure virtual function</b>.</p>\n\n<hr />"

            "<h2>Data Abstraction in C++</h2>\n\n<p>Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details, i.e., to represent the needed information in program without presenting the details.</p>\n\n<p>Data abstraction is a programming (and design) technique that relies on the separation of interface and implementation.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s take one real life example of a TV, which you can turn on and off, change the channel, adjust the volume, and add external components such as speakers, VCRs, and DVD players, BUT you do not know its internal details, that is, you do not know how it receives signals over the air or through a cable, how it translates them, and finally displays them on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we can say a television clearly separates its internal implementation from its external interface and you can play with its interfaces like the power button, channel changer, and volume control without having any knowledge of its internals.</p>\n\n<p>In C++, classes provides great level of <b>data abstraction</b>. They provide sufficient public methods to the outside world to play with the functionality of the object and to manipulate object data, i.e., state without actually knowing how class has been implemented internally.</p>\n\n<p>For example, your program can make a call to the <b>sort()</b> function without knowing what algorithm the function actually uses to sort the given values. In fact, the underlying implementation of the sorting functionality could change between releases of the library, and as long as the interface stays the same, your function call will still work.</p>\n\n<p>In C++, we use <b>classes</b> to define our own abstract data types (ADT). You can use the <b>cout</b> object of class <b>ostream</b> to stream data to standard output like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\" href=\"http://tpcg.io/iaAqF8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Live Demo</a></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"com\">#include</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">using</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">namespace</span><span class=\"pln\"> std</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> main</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   cout </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&quot;Hello C++&quot;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\">endl</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<p>Here, you don&#39;t need to understand how <b>cout</b> displays the text on the user&#39;s screen. You need to only know the public interface and the underlying implementation of &lsquo;cout&rsquo; is free to change.</p>\n\n<h2>Access Labels Enforce Abstraction</h2>\n\n<p>In C++, we use access labels to define the abstract interface to the class. A class may contain zero or more access labels &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Members defined with a public label are accessible to all parts of the program. The data-abstraction view of a type is defined by its public members.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Members defined with a private label are not accessible to code that uses the class. The private sections hide the implementation from code that uses the type.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are no restrictions on how often an access label may appear. Each access label specifies the access level of the succeeding member definitions. The specified access level remains in effect until the next access label is encountered or the closing right brace of the class body is seen.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits of Data Abstraction</h2>\n\n<p>Data abstraction provides two important advantages &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Class internals are protected from inadvertent user-level errors, which might corrupt the state of the object.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The class implementation may evolve over time in response to changing requirements or bug reports without requiring change in user-level code.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By defining data members only in the private section of the class, the class author is free to make changes in the data.

            "<h2>Data Encapsulation in C++</h2>\n\n<p>All C++ programs are composed of the following two fundamental elements &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Program statements (code)</b> &minus; This is the part of a program that performs actions and they are called functions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Program data</b> &minus; The data is the information of the program which gets affected by the program functions.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of <b>data hiding</b>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Data encapsulation</b> is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and <b>data abstraction</b> is a mechanism of exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.</p>\n\n<p>C++ supports the properties of encapsulation and data hiding through the creation of user-defined types, called <b>classes</b>. We already have studied that a class can contain <b>private, protected </b> and <b>public</b> members. By default, all items defined in a class are private. For example &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nclass Box {\n   public:\n      double getVolume(void) {\n         return length * breadth * height;\n      }\n\n   private:\n      double length;      // Length of a box\n      double breadth;     // Breadth of a box\n      double height;      // Height of a box\n};\n</pre>\n\n<p>The variables length, breadth, and height are <b>private</b>. This means that they can be accessed only by other members of the Box class, and not by any other part of your program. This is one way encapsulation is achieved.</p>\n\n<p>To make parts of a class <b>public</b> (i.e., accessible to other parts of your program), you must declare them after the <b>public</b> keyword. All variables or functions defined after the public specifier are accessible by all other functions in your program.</p>\n\n<p>Making one class a friend of another exposes the implementation details and reduces encapsulation. The ideal is to keep as many of the details of each class hidden from all other classes as possible.</p>\n\n<h2>Data Encapsulation Example</h2>\n\n<p>Any C++ program where you implement a class with public and private members is an example of data encapsulation and data abstraction.

            "<h2>Types of Operating System</h2>\n\n<p>Operating systems are there from the very first computer generation and they keep evolving with time. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the important types of operating systems which are most commonly used.</p>\n\n<h2>Batch operating system</h2>\n\n<p>The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. To speed up processing, jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group. The programmers leave their programs with the operator and the operator then sorts the programs with similar requirements into batches.</p>\n\n<p>The problems with Batch Systems are as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Lack of interaction between the user and the job.</li>\n\t<li>CPU is often idle, because the speed of the mechanical I/O devices is slower than the CPU.</li>\n\t<li>Difficult to provide the desired priority.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Time-sharing operating systems</h2>\n\n<p>Time-sharing is a technique which enables many people, located at various terminals, to use a particular computer system at the same time. Time-sharing or multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming. Processor&#39;s time which is shared among multiple users simultaneously is termed as time-sharing.</p>\n\n<p>The main difference between Multiprogrammed Batch Systems and Time-Sharing Systems is that in case of Multiprogrammed batch systems, the objective is to maximize processor use, whereas in Time-Sharing Systems, the objective is to minimize response time.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by switching between them, but the switches occur so frequently. Thus, the user can receive an immediate response. For example, in a transaction processing, the processor executes each user program in a short burst or quantum of computation. That is, if <b>n</b> users are present, then each user can get a time quantum. When the user submits the command, the response time is in few seconds at most.</p>\n\n<p>The operating system uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small portion of a time. Computer systems that were designed primarily as batch systems have been modified to time-sharing systems.</p>\n\n<p>Advantages of Timesharing operating systems are as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Provides the advantage of quick response.</li>\n\t<li>Avoids duplication of software.</li>\n\t<li>Reduces CPU idle time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Disadvantages of Time-sharing operating systems are as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Problem of reliability.</li>\n\t<li>Question of security and integrity of user programs and data.</li>\n\t<li>Problem of data communication.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Distributed operating System</h2>\n\n<p>Distributed systems use multiple central processors to serve multiple real-time applications and multiple users. Data processing jobs are distributed among the processors accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>The processors communicate with one another through various communication lines (such as high-speed buses or telephone lines). These are referred as <b>loosely coupled systems</b> or distributed systems. Processors in a distributed system may vary in size and function. These processors are referred as sites, nodes, computers, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The advantages of distributed systems are as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>With resource sharing facility, a user at one site may be able to use the resources available at another.</li>\n\t<li>Speedup the exchange of data with one another via electronic mail.</li>\n\t<li>If one site fails in a distributed system, the remaining sites can potentially continue operating.</li>\n\t<li>Better service to the customers.</li>\n\t<li>Reduction of the load on the host computer.</li>\n\t<li>Reduction of delays in data processing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Network operating System</h2>\n\n<p>A Network Operating System runs on a server and provides the server the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. The primary purpose of the network operating system is to allow shared file and printer access among multiple computers in a network, typically a local area network (LAN), a private network or to other networks.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of network operating systems include Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD.</p>\n\n<p>The advantages of network operating systems are as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Centralized servers are highly stable.</li>\n\t<li>Security is server managed.</li>\n\t<li>Upgrades to new technologies and hardware can be easily integrated into the system.</li>\n\t<li>Remote access to servers is possible from different locations and types of systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The disadvantages of network operating systems are as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>High cost of buying and running a server.</li>\n\t<li>Dependency on a central location for most operations.</li>\n\t<li>Regular maintenance and updates are required.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Real Time operating System</h2>\n\n<p>A real-time system is defined as a data processing system in which the time interval required to process and respond to inputs is so small that it controls the environment. The time taken by the system to respond to an input and display of required updated information is termed as the <b>response time</b>. So in this method, the response time is very less as compared to online processing.</p>\n\n<p>Real-time systems are used when there are rigid time requirements on the operation of a processor or the flow of data and real-time systems can be used as a control device in a dedicated application. A real-time operating system must have well-defined, fixed time constraints, otherwise the system will fail. For example, Scientific experiments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, weapon systems, robots, air traffic control systems, etc.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of real-time operating systems.</p>\n\n<h3>Hard real-time systems</h3>\n\n<p>Hard real-time systems guarantee that critical tasks complete on time. In hard real-time systems, secondary storage is limited or missing and the data is stored in ROM. In these systems, virtual memory is almost never found.</p>\n\n<h3>Soft real-time systems</h3>\n\n<p>Soft real-time systems are less restrictive. A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and retains the priority until it completes. Soft real-time systems have limited utility than hard real-time systems. For example, multimedia, virtual reality, Advanced Scientific Projects like undersea exploration and planetary rovers, etc.</p>\n"

            "<h1>Operating System - Process Scheduling</h1>\n\n<h2>Definition</h2>\n\n<p>The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.</p>\n\n<h2>Process Scheduling Queues</h2>\n\n<p>The OS maintains all PCBs in Process Scheduling Queues. The OS maintains a separate queue for each of the process states and PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue. When the state of a process is changed, its PCB is unlinked from its current queue and moved to its new state queue.</p>\n\n<p>The Operating System maintains the following important process scheduling queues &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Job queue</b> &minus; This queue keeps all the processes in the system.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Ready queue</b> &minus; This queue keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute. A new process is always put in this queue.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Device queues</b> &minus; The processes which are blocked due to unavailability of an I/O device constitute this queue.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Process Scheduling Queuing\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/queuing_diagram.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The OS can use different policies to manage each queue (FIFO, Round Robin, Priority, etc.). The OS scheduler determines how to move processes between the ready and run queues which can only have one entry per processor core on the system; in the above diagram, it has been merged with the CPU.</p>\n\n<h2>Two-State Process Model</h2>\n\n<p>Two-state process model refers to running and non-running states which are described below &minus;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:5%;\">S.N.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">State &amp; Description</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>Running</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>When a new process is created, it enters into the system as in the running state.</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>Not Running</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Processes that are not running are kept in queue, waiting for their turn to execute. Each entry in the queue is a pointer to a particular process. Queue is implemented by using linked list. Use of dispatcher is as follows. When a process is interrupted, that process is transferred in the waiting queue. If the process has completed or aborted, the process is discarded. In either case, the dispatcher then selects a process from the queue to execute.</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Schedulers</h2>\n\n<p>Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways. Their main task is to select the jobs to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run. Schedulers are of three types &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Long-Term Scheduler</li>\n\t<li>Short-Term Scheduler</li>\n\t<li>Medium-Term Scheduler</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Long Term Scheduler</h2>\n\n<p>It is also called a <b>job scheduler</b>. A long-term scheduler determines which programs are admitted to the system for processing. It selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for execution. Process loads into the memory for CPU scheduling.</p>\n\n<p>The primary objective of the job scheduler is to provide a balanced mix of jobs, such as I/O bound and processor bound. It also controls the degree of multiprogramming. If the degree of multiprogramming is stable, then the average rate of process creation must be equal to the average departure rate of processes leaving the system.</p>\n\n<p>On some systems, the long-term scheduler may not be available or minimal. Time-sharing operating systems have no long term scheduler. When a process changes the state from new to ready, then there is use of long-term scheduler.</p>\n\n<h2>Short Term Scheduler</h2>\n\n<p>It is also called as <b>CPU scheduler</b>. Its main objective is to increase system performance in accordance with the chosen set of criteria. It is the change of ready state to running state of the process. CPU scheduler selects a process among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates CPU to one of them.</p>\n\n<p>Short-term schedulers, also known as dispatchers, make the decision of which process to execute next. Short-term schedulers are faster than long-term schedulers.</p>\n\n<h2>Medium Term Scheduler</h2>\n\n<p>Medium-term scheduling is a part of <b>swapping</b>. It removes the processes from the memory. It reduces the degree of multiprogramming. The medium-term scheduler is in-charge of handling the swapped out-processes.</p>\n\n<p>A running process may become suspended if it makes an I/O request. A suspended processes cannot make any progress towards completion. In this condition, to remove the process from memory and make space for other processes, the suspended process is moved to the secondary storage. This process is called <b>swapping</b>, and the process is said to be swapped out or rolled out. Swapping may be necessary to improve the process mix.</p>\n\n<h2>Comparison among Scheduler</h2>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:5%;\">S.N.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">Long-Term Scheduler</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">Short-Term Scheduler</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">Medium-Term Scheduler</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It is a job scheduler</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It is a CPU scheduler</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It is a process swapping scheduler.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Speed is lesser than short term scheduler</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Speed is fastest among other two</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Speed is in between both short and long term scheduler.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It controls the degree of multiprogramming</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It provides lesser control over degree of multiprogramming</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It reduces the degree of multiprogramming.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It is almost absent or minimal in time sharing system</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It is also minimal in time sharing system</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It is a part of Time sharing systems.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It selects processes from pool and loads them into memory for execution</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It selects those processes which are ready to execute</td>\n\t\t\t<td>It can re-introduce the process into memory and execution can be continued.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Context Switch</h2>\n\n<p>A context switch is the mechanism to store and restore the state or context of a CPU in Process Control block so that a process execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. Using this technique, a context switcher enables multiple processes to share a single CPU. Context switching is an essential part of a multitasking operating system features.</p>\n\n<p>When the scheduler switches the CPU from executing one process to execute another, the state from the current running process is stored into the process control block. After this, the state for the process to run next is loaded from its own PCB and used to set the PC, registers, etc. At that point, the second process can start executing.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Process Context Switch\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/context_switch.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Context switches are computationally intensive since register and memory state must be saved and restored. To avoid the amount of context switching time, some hardware systems employ two or more sets of processor registers. When the process is switched, the following information is stored for later use.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Program Counter</li>\n\t<li>Scheduling information</li>\n\t<li>Base and limit register value</li>\n\t<li>Currently used register</li>\n\t<li>Changed State</li>\n\t<li>I/O State information</li>\n\t<li>Accounting information</li>\n</ul>\n"

            "<h2>Operating System - Multi-Threading</h2>\n\n<h2>What is Thread?</h2>\n\n<p>A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.</p>\n\n<p>A thread shares with its peer threads few information like code segment, data segment and open files. When one thread alters a code segment memory item, all other threads see that.</p>\n\n<p>A thread is also called a <b>lightweight process</b>. Threads provide a way to improve application performance through parallelism. Threads represent a software approach to improving performance of operating system by reducing the overhead thread is equivalent to a classical process.</p>\n\n<p>Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control. Threads have been successfully used in implementing network servers and web server. They also provide a suitable foundation for parallel execution of applications on shared memory multiprocessors. The following figure shows the working of a single-threaded and a multithreaded process.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Single vs Multithreaded Process\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/thread_processes.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Difference between Process and Thread</h2>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:5%;\">S.N.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:45%;\">Process</th>\n\t\t\t<th>Thread</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Process is heavy weight or resource intensive.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Thread is light weight, taking lesser resources than a process.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Process switching needs interaction with operating system.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Thread switching does not need to interact with operating system.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>In multiple processing environments, each process executes the same code but has its own memory and file resources.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>All threads can share same set of open files, child processes.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>If one process is blocked, then no other process can execute until the first process is unblocked.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>While one thread is blocked and waiting, a second thread in the same task can run.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Multiple processes without using threads use more resources.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Multiple threaded processes use fewer resources.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t<td>In multiple processes each process operates independently of the others.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>One thread can read, write or change another thread&#39;s data.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Advantages of Thread</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Threads minimize the context switching time.</li>\n\t<li>Use of threads provides concurrency within a process.</li>\n\t<li>Efficient communication.</li>\n\t<li>It is more economical to create and context switch threads.</li>\n\t<li>Threads allow utilization of multiprocessor architectures to a greater scale and efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Types of Thread</h2>\n\n<p>Threads are implemented in following two ways &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>User Level Threads</b> &minus; User managed threads.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Kernel Level Threads</b> &minus; Operating System managed threads acting on kernel, an operating system core.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>User Level Threads</h2>\n\n<p>In this case, the thread management kernel is not aware of the existence of threads. The thread library contains code for creating and destroying threads, for passing message and data between threads, for scheduling thread execution and for saving and restoring thread contexts.

There is no thread management code in the application area. Kernel threads are supported directly by the operating system. Any application can be programmed to be multithreaded. All of the threads within an application are supported within a single process.</p>\n\n<p>The Kernel maintains context information for the process as a whole and for individuals threads within the process. Scheduling by the Kernel is done on a thread basis. The Kernel performs thread creation, scheduling and management in Kernel space. Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</p>\n\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple processes.</li>\n\t<li>If one thread in a process is blocked, the Kernel can schedule another thread of the same process.</li>\n\t<li>Kernel routines themselves can be multithreaded.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Disadvantages</h3>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.</li>\n\t<li>Transfer of control from one thread to another within the same process requires a mode switch to the Kernel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Multithreading Models</h2>\n\n<p>Some operating system provide a combined user level thread and Kernel level thread facility. Solaris is a good example of this combined approach. In a combined system, multiple threads within the same application can run in parallel on multiple processors and a blocking system call need not block the entire process. Multithreading models are three types</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Many to many relationship.</li>\n\t<li>Many to one relationship.</li>\n\t<li>One to one relationship.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Many to Many Model</h2>\n\n<p>The many-to-many model multiplexes any number of user threads onto an equal or smaller number of kernel threads.</p>\n\n<p>The following diagram shows the many-to-many threading model where 6 user level threads are multiplexing with 6 kernel level threads. In this model, developers can create as many user threads as necessary and the corresponding Kernel threads can run in parallel on a multiprocessor machine. This model provides the best accuracy on concurrency and when a thread performs a blocking system call, the kernel can schedule another thread for execution.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Many to many thread model\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/many_to_many.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Many to One Model</h2>\n\n<p>Many-to-one model maps many user level threads to one Kernel-level thread. Thread management is done in user space by the thread library. When thread makes a blocking system call, the entire process will be blocked. Only one thread can access the Kernel at a time, so multiple threads are unable to run in parallel on multiprocessors.</p>\n\n<p>If the user-level thread libraries are implemented in the operating system in such a way that the system does not support them, then the Kernel threads use the many-to-one relationship modes.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Many to one thread model\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/many_to_one.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>One to One Model</h2>\n\n<p>There is one-to-one relationship of user-level thread to the kernel-level thread. This model provides more concurrency than the many-to-one model. It also allows another thread to run when a thread makes a blocking system call. It supports multiple threads to execute in parallel on microprocessors.</p>\n\n<p>Disadvantage of this model is that creating user thread requires the corresponding Kernel thread. OS/2, windows NT and windows 2000 use one to one relationship model.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"One to one thread model\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/one_to_one.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Difference between User-Level &amp; Kernel-Level Thread</h2>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:5%; text-align:center\">S.N.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:45%; text-align:center\">User-Level Threads</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:45%; text-align:center\">Kernel-Level Thread</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>User-level threads are faster to create and manage.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Kernel-level threads are slower to create and manage.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Implementation is by a thread library at the user level.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Operating system supports creation of Kernel threads.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>User-level thread is generic and can run on any operating system.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Kernel-level thread is specific to the operating system.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Multi-threaded applications cannot take advantage of multiprocessing.</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Kernel routines themselves can be multithreaded.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<hr />"

            "<h2>Operating System - Memory Management</h2>\n\n<p>Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status.</p>\n\n<p>This tutorial will teach you basic concepts related to Memory Management.</p>\n\n<h2>Process Address Space</h2>\n\n<p>The process address space is the set of logical addresses that a process references in its code. For example, when 32-bit addressing is in use, addresses can range from 0 to 0x7fffffff; that is, 2^31 possible numbers, for a total theoretical size of 2 gigabytes.</p>\n\n<p>The operating system takes care of mapping the logical addresses to physical addresses at the time of memory allocation to the program. There are three types of addresses used in a program before and after memory is allocated &minus;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>S.N.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">Memory Addresses &amp; Description</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>Symbolic addresses</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>The addresses used in a source code.

Virtual and physical addresses differ in execution-time address-binding scheme.</p>\n\n<p>The set of all logical addresses generated by a program is referred to as a <b>logical address space</b>. The set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses is referred to as a <b>physical address space.</b></p>\n\n<p>The runtime mapping from virtual to physical address is done by the memory management unit (MMU) which is a hardware device. MMU uses following mechanism to convert virtual address to physical address.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The value in the base register is added to every address generated by a user process, which is treated as offset at the time it is sent to memory. For example, if the base register value is 10000, then an attempt by the user to use address location 100 will be dynamically reallocated to location 10100.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The user program deals with virtual addresses; it never sees the real physical addresses.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Static vs Dynamic Loading</h2>\n\n<p>The choice between Static or Dynamic Loading is to be made at the time of computer program being developed. If you have to load your program statically, then at the time of compilation, the complete programs will be compiled and linked without leaving any external program or module dependency. The linker combines the object program with other necessary object modules into an absolute program, which also includes logical addresses.</p>\n\n<p>If you are writing a Dynamically loaded program, then your compiler will compile the program and for all the modules which you want to include dynamically, only references will be provided and rest of the work will be done at the time of execution.</p>\n\n<p>At the time of loading, with <b>static loading</b>, the absolute program (and data) is loaded into memory in order for execution to start.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using <b>dynamic loading</b>, dynamic routines of the library are stored on a disk in relocatable form and are loaded into memory only when they are needed by the program.</p>\n\n<h2>Static vs Dynamic Linking</h2>\n\n<p>As explained above, when static linking is used, the linker combines all other modules needed by a program into a single executable program to avoid any runtime dependency.</p>\n\n<p>When dynamic linking is used, it is not required to link the actual module or library with the program, rather a reference to the dynamic module is provided at the time of compilation and linking. Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) in Windows and Shared Objects in Unix are good examples of dynamic libraries.</p>\n\n<h2>Swapping</h2>\n\n<p>Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory (or move) to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes. At some later time, the system swaps back the process from the secondary storage to main memory.</p>\n\n<p>Though performance is usually affected by swapping process but it helps in running multiple and big processes in parallel and that&#39;s the reason <b>Swapping is also known as a technique for memory compaction</b>.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Process Swapping\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/process_swapping.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The total time taken by swapping process includes the time it takes to move the entire process to a secondary disk and then to copy the process back to memory, as well as the time the process takes to regain main memory.</p>\n\n<p>Let us assume that the user process is of size 2048KB and on a standard hard disk where swapping will take place has a data transfer rate around 1 MB per second. The actual transfer of the 1000K process to or from memory will take</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n2048KB / 1024KB per second\n= 2 seconds\n= 2000 milliseconds\n</pre>\n\n<p>Now considering in and out time, it will take complete 4000 milliseconds plus other overhead where the process competes to regain main memory.</p>\n\n<h2>Memory Allocation</h2>\n\n<p>Main memory usually has two partitions &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Low Memory</b> &minus; Operating system resides in this memory.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>High Memory</b> &minus; User processes are held in high memory.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Operating system uses the following memory allocation mechanism.</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>S.N.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">Memory Allocation &amp; Description</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>Single-partition allocation</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>In this type of allocation, relocation-register scheme is used to protect user processes from each other, and from changing operating-system code and data.

When the process terminates, the partition becomes available for another process.</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Fragmentation</h2>\n\n<p>As processes are loaded and removed from memory, the free memory space is broken into little pieces. It happens after sometimes that processes cannot be allocated to memory blocks considering their small size and memory blocks remains unused. This problem is known as Fragmentation.</p>\n\n<p>Fragmentation is of two types &minus;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th>S.N.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">Fragmentation &amp; Description</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>External fragmentation</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Total memory space is enough to satisfy a request or to reside a process in it, but it is not contiguous, so it cannot be used.</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<p><b>Internal fragmentation</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Memory block assigned to process is bigger.

To make compaction feasible, relocation should be dynamic.</p>\n\n<p>The internal fragmentation can be reduced by effectively assigning the smallest partition but large enough for the process.</p>\n\n<h2>Paging</h2>\n\n<p>A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard that&#39;s set up to emulate the computer&#39;s RAM. Paging technique plays an important role in implementing virtual memory.</p>\n\n<p>Paging is a memory management technique in which process address space is broken into blocks of the same size called <b>pages</b> (size is power of 2, between 512 bytes and 8192 bytes). The size of the process is measured in the number of pages.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, main memory is divided into small fixed-sized blocks of (physical) memory called <b>frames</b> and the size of a frame is kept the same as that of a page to have optimum utilization of the main memory and to avoid external fragmentation.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Paging\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/paging.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3>Address Translation</h3>\n\n<p>Page address is called <b>logical address</b> and represented by <b>page number</b> and the <b>offset</b>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nLogical Address = Page number + page offset\n</pre>\n\n<p>Frame address is called <b>physical address</b> and represented by a <b>frame number</b> and the <b>offset</b>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nPhysical Address = Frame number + page offset\n</pre>\n\n<p>A data structure called <b>page map table</b> is used to keep track of the relation between a page of a process to a frame in physical memory.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Page Map Table\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/page_map_table.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>When the system allocates a frame to any page, it translates this logical address into a physical address and create entry into the page table to be used throughout execution of the program.</p>\n\n<p>When a process is to be executed, its corresponding pages are loaded into any available memory frames. Suppose you have a program of 8Kb but your memory can accommodate only 5Kb at a given point in time, then the paging concept will come into picture. When a computer runs out of RAM, the operating system (OS) will move idle or unwanted pages of memory to secondary memory to free up RAM for other processes and brings them back when needed by the program.</p>\n\n<p>This process continues during the whole execution of the program where the OS keeps removing idle pages from the main memory and write them onto the secondary memory and bring them back when required by the program.</p>\n\n<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Paging</h3>\n\n<p>Here is a list of advantages and disadvantages of paging &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Paging reduces external fragmentation, but still suffer from internal fragmentation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Paging is simple to implement and assumed as an efficient memory management technique.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Due to equal size of the pages and frames, swapping becomes very easy.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Page table requires extra memory space, so may not be good for a system having small RAM.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Segmentation</h2>\n\n<p>Segmentation is a memory management technique in which each job is divided into several segments of different sizes, one for each module that contains pieces that perform related functions. Each segment is actually a different logical address space of the program.</p>\n\n<p>When a process is to be executed, its corresponding segmentation are loaded into non-contiguous memory though every segment is loaded into a contiguous block of available memory.</p>\n\n<p>Segmentation memory management works very similar to paging but here segments are of variable-length where as in paging pages are of fixed size.</p>\n\n<p>A program segment contains the program&#39;s main function, utility functions, data structures, and so on. The operating system maintains a <b>segment map table</b> for every process and a list of free memory blocks along with segment numbers, their size and corresponding memory locations in main memory. For each segment, the table stores the starting address of the segment and the length of the segment. A reference to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Segment Map Table\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/segment_map_table.jpg\" /></p>\n"

Virtual memory serves two purposes. First, it allows us to extend the use of physical memory by using disk. Second, it allows us to have memory protection, because each virtual address is translated to a physical address.</p>\n\n<p>Following are the situations, when entire program is not required to be loaded fully in main memory.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>User written error handling routines are used only when an error occurred in the data or computation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Certain options and features of a program may be used rarely.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Many tables are assigned a fixed amount of address space even though only a small amount of the table is actually used.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The ability to execute a program that is only partially in memory would counter many benefits.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Less number of I/O would be needed to load or swap each user program into memory.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A program would no longer be constrained by the amount of physical memory that is available.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Each user program could take less physical memory, more programs could be run the same time, with a corresponding increase in CPU utilization and throughput.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Modern microprocessors intended for general-purpose use, a memory management unit, or MMU, is built into the hardware. The MMU&#39;s job is to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses. A basic example is given below &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Virtual Memory\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/virtual_memory.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Virtual memory is commonly implemented by demand paging. It can also be implemented in a segmentation system. Demand segmentation can also be used to provide virtual memory.</p>\n\n<h2>Demand Paging</h2>\n\n<p>A demand paging system is quite similar to a paging system with swapping where processes reside in secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. When a context switch occurs, the operating system does not copy any of the old program&rsquo;s pages out to the disk or any of the new program&rsquo;s pages into the main memory Instead, it just begins executing the new program after loading the first page and fetches that program&rsquo;s pages as they are referenced.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Demand Paging\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/demand_paging.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>While executing a program, if the program references a page which is not available in the main memory because it was swapped out a little ago, the processor treats this invalid memory reference as a <b>page fault</b> and transfers control from the program to the operating system to demand the page back into the memory.</p>\n\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n\n<p>Following are the advantages of Demand Paging &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Large virtual memory.</li>\n\t<li>More efficient use of memory.</li>\n\t<li>There is no limit on degree of multiprogramming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Disadvantages</h3>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Number of tables and the amount of processor overhead for handling page interrupts are greater than in the case of the simple paged management techniques.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Page Replacement Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>Page replacement algorithms are the techniques using which an Operating System decides which memory pages to swap out, write to disk when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Paging happens whenever a page fault occurs and a free page cannot be used for allocation purpose accounting to reason that pages are not available or the number of free pages is lower than required pages.</p>\n\n<p>When the page that was selected for replacement and was paged out, is referenced again, it has to read in from disk, and this requires for I/O completion. This process determines the quality of the page replacement algorithm: the lesser the time waiting for page-ins, the better is the algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>A page replacement algorithm looks at the limited information about accessing the pages provided by hardware, and tries to select which pages should be replaced to minimize the total number of page misses, while balancing it with the costs of primary storage and processor time of the algorithm itself. There are many different page replacement algorithms. We evaluate an algorithm by running it on a particular string of memory reference and computing the number of page faults,</p>\n\n<h2>Reference String</h2>\n\n<p>The string of memory references is called reference string.

            "<h2>Operating System - I/O Hardware</h2>\n\n<p>One of the important jobs of an Operating System is to manage various I/O devices including mouse, keyboards, touch pad, disk drives, display adapters, USB devices, Bit-mapped screen, LED, Analog-to-digital converter, On/off switch, network connections, audio I/O, printers etc.</p>\n\n<p>An I/O system is required to take an application I/O request and send it to the physical device, then take whatever response comes back from the device and send it to the application. I/O devices can be divided into two categories &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Block devices</b> &minus; A block device is one with which the driver communicates by sending entire blocks of data. For example, Hard disks, USB cameras, Disk-On-Key etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Character devices</b> &minus; A character device is one with which the driver communicates by sending and receiving single characters (bytes, octets). For example, serial ports, parallel ports, sounds cards etc</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Device Controllers</h2>\n\n<p>Device drivers are software modules that can be plugged into an OS to handle a particular device. Operating System takes help from device drivers to handle all I/O devices.</p>\n\n<p>The Device Controller works like an interface between a device and a device driver. I/O units (Keyboard, mouse, printer, etc.) typically consist of a mechanical component and an electronic component where electronic component is called the device controller.</p>\n\n<p>There is always a device controller and a device driver for each device to communicate with the Operating Systems. A device controller may be able to handle multiple devices. As an interface its main task is to convert serial bit stream to block of bytes, perform error correction as necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Any device connected to the computer is connected by a plug and socket, and the socket is connected to a device controller. Following is a model for connecting the CPU, memory, controllers, and I/O devices where CPU and device controllers all use a common bus for communication.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Device Controllers\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/device_controllers.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Synchronous vs asynchronous I/O</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Synchronous I/O</b> &minus; In this scheme CPU execution waits while I/O proceeds</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Asynchronous I/O</b> &minus; I/O proceeds concurrently with CPU execution</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Communication to I/O Devices</h2>\n\n<p>The CPU must have a way to pass information to and from an I/O device. There are three approaches available to communicate with the CPU and Device.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Special Instruction I/O</li>\n\t<li>Memory-mapped I/O</li>\n\t<li>Direct memory access (DMA)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Special Instruction I/O</h3>\n\n<p>This uses CPU instructions that are specifically made for controlling I/O devices. These instructions typically allow data to be sent to an I/O device or read from an I/O device.</p>\n\n<h3>Memory-mapped I/O</h3>\n\n<p>When using memory-mapped I/O, the same address space is shared by memory and I/O devices. The device is connected directly to certain main memory locations so that I/O device can transfer block of data to/from memory without going through CPU.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Memory-mapped I/O\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/memory_mapped_io.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>While using memory mapped IO, OS allocates buffer in memory and informs I/O device to use that buffer to send data to the CPU. I/O device operates asynchronously with CPU, interrupts CPU when finished.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage to this method is that every instruction which can access memory can be used to manipulate an I/O device. Memory mapped IO is used for most high-speed I/O devices like disks, communication interfaces.</p>\n\n<h2>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</h2>\n\n<p>Slow devices like keyboards will generate an interrupt to the main CPU after each byte is transferred. If a fast device such as a disk generated an interrupt for each byte, the operating system would spend most of its time handling these interrupts. So a typical computer uses direct memory access (DMA) hardware to reduce this overhead.</p>\n\n<p>Direct Memory Access (DMA) means CPU grants I/O module authority to read from or write to memory without involvement. DMA module itself controls exchange of data between main memory and the I/O device. CPU is only involved at the beginning and end of the transfer and interrupted only after entire block has been transferred.</p>\n\n<p>Direct Memory Access needs a special hardware called DMA controller (DMAC) that manages the data transfers and arbitrates access to the system bus. The controllers are programmed with source and destination pointers (where to read/write the data), counters to track the number of transferred bytes, and settings, which includes I/O and memory types, interrupts and states for the CPU cycles.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"DMA\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/dma.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The operating system uses the DMA hardware as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"width:5%;\">Step</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center\">Description</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Device driver is instructed to transfer disk data to a buffer address X.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Device driver then instruct disk controller to transfer data to buffer.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Disk controller starts DMA transfer.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Disk controller sends each byte to DMA controller.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>DMA controller transfers bytes to buffer, increases the memory address, decreases the counter C until C becomes zero.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t<td>When C becomes zero, DMA interrupts CPU to signal transfer completion.</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Polling vs Interrupts I/O</h2>\n\n<p>A computer must have a way of detecting the arrival of any type of input. There are two ways that this can happen, known as <b>polling</b> and <b>interrupts</b>. Both of these techniques allow the processor to deal with events that can happen at any time and that are not related to the process it is currently running.</p>\n\n<h3>Polling I/O</h3>\n\n<p>Polling is the simplest way for an I/O device to communicate with the processor. The process of periodically checking status of the device to see if it is time for the next I/O operation, is called polling. The I/O device simply puts the information in a Status register, and the processor must come and get the information.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time, devices will not require attention and when one does it will have to wait until it is next interrogated by the polling program. This is an inefficient method and much of the processors time is wasted on unnecessary polls.</p>\n\n<p>Compare this method to a teacher continually asking every student in a class, one after another, if they need help. Obviously the more efficient method would be for a student to inform the teacher whenever they require assistance.</p>\n\n<h3>Interrupts I/O</h3>\n\n<p>An alternative scheme for dealing with I/O is the interrupt-driven method. An interrupt is a signal to the microprocessor from a device that requires attention.</p>\n\n<p>A device controller puts an interrupt signal on the bus when it needs CPU&rsquo;s attention when CPU receives an interrupt, It saves its current state and invokes the appropriate interrupt handler using the interrupt vector (addresses of OS routines to handle various events). When the interrupting device has been dealt with, the CPU continues with its original task as if it had never been interrupted.</p>\n"

            "<h2>Operating System - I/O Softwares</h2>\n\n<p>I/O software is often organized in the following layers &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>User Level Libraries</b> &minus; This provides simple interface to the user program to perform input and output. For example, <b>stdio</b> is a library provided by C and C++ programming languages.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Kernel Level Modules</b> &minus; This provides device driver to interact with the device controller and device independent I/O modules used by the device drivers.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Hardware</b> &minus; This layer includes actual hardware and hardware controller which interact with the device drivers and makes hardware alive.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A key concept in the design of I/O software is that it should be device independent where it should be possible to write programs that can access any I/O device without having to specify the device in advance. For example, a program that reads a file as input should be able to read a file on a floppy disk, on a hard disk, or on a CD-ROM, without having to modify the program for each different device.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"I/O Softwares\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/images/io_software.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Device Drivers</h2>\n\n<p>Device drivers are software modules that can be plugged into an OS to handle a particular device. Operating System takes help from device drivers to handle all I/O devices. Device drivers encapsulate device-dependent code and implement a standard interface in such a way that code contains device-specific register reads/writes. Device driver, is generally written by the device&#39;s manufacturer and delivered along with the device on a CD-ROM.</p>\n\n<p>A device driver performs the following jobs &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>To accept request from the device independent software above to it.</li>\n\t<li>Interact with the device controller to take and give I/O and perform required error handling</li>\n\t<li>Making sure that the request is executed successfully</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How a device driver handles a request is as follows: Suppose a request comes to read a block N. If the driver is idle at the time a request arrives, it starts carrying out the request immediately. Otherwise, if the driver is already busy with some other request, it places the new request in the queue of pending requests.</p>\n\n<h2>Interrupt handlers</h2>\n\n<p>An interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a piece of software or more specifically a callback function in an operating system or more specifically in a device driver, whose execution is triggered by the reception of an interrupt.</p>\n\n<p>When the interrupt happens, the interrupt procedure does whatever it has to in order to handle the interrupt, updates data structures and wakes up process that was waiting for an interrupt to happen.</p>\n\n<p>The interrupt mechanism accepts an address ─ a number that selects a specific interrupt handling routine/function from a small set. In most architectures, this address is an offset stored in a table called the interrupt vector table. This vector contains the memory addresses of specialized interrupt handlers.</p>\n\n<h2>Device-Independent I/O Software</h2>\n\n<p>The basic function of the device-independent software is to perform the I/O functions that are common to all devices and to provide a uniform interface to the user-level software. Though it is difficult to write completely device independent software but we can write some modules which are common among all the devices. Following is a list of functions of device-independent I/O Software &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Uniform interfacing for device drivers</li>\n\t<li>Device naming - Mnemonic names mapped to Major and Minor device numbers</li>\n\t<li>Device protection</li>\n\t<li>Providing a device-independent block size</li>\n\t<li>Buffering because data coming off a device cannot be stored in final destination.</li>\n\t<li>Storage allocation on block devices</li>\n\t<li>Allocation and releasing dedicated devices</li>\n\t<li>Error Reporting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>User-Space I/O Software</h2>\n\n<p>These are the libraries which provide richer and simplified interface to access the functionality of the kernel or ultimately interactive with the device drivers. Most of the user-level I/O software consists of library procedures with some exception like spooling system which is a way of dealing with dedicated I/O devices in a multiprogramming system.</p>\n\n<p>I/O Libraries (e.g., stdio) are in user-space to provide an interface to the OS resident device-independent I/O SW. For example putchar(), getchar(), printf() and scanf() are example of user level I/O library stdio available in C programming.</p>\n\n<h2>Kernel I/O Subsystem</h2>\n\n<p>Kernel I/O Subsystem is responsible to provide many services related to I/O. Following are some of the services provided.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Scheduling</b> &minus; Kernel schedules a set of I/O requests to determine a good order in which to execute them. When an application issues a blocking I/O system call, the request is placed on the queue for that device. The Kernel I/O scheduler rearranges the order of the queue to improve the overall system efficiency and the average response time experienced by the applications.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Buffering</b> &minus; Kernel I/O Subsystem maintains a memory area known as <b>buffer</b> that stores data while they are transferred between two devices or between a device with an application operation. Buffering is done to cope with a speed mismatch between the producer and consumer of a data stream or to adapt between devices that have different data transfer sizes.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Caching</b> &minus; Kernel maintains cache memory which is region of fast memory that holds copies of data. Access to the cached copy is more efficient than access to the original.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Spooling and Device Reservation</b> &minus; A spool is a buffer that holds output for a device, such as a printer, that cannot accept interleaved data streams. The spooling system copies the queued spool files to the printer one at a time. In some operating systems, spooling is managed by a system daemon process. In other operating systems, it is handled by an in kernel thread.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Error Handling</b> &minus; An operating system that uses protected memory can guard against many kinds of hardware and application errors.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />"

If a computer program is run by an unauthorized user, then he/she may cause severe damage to computer or data stored in it. So a computer system must be protected against unauthorized access, malicious access to system memory, viruses, worms etc. We&#39;re going to discuss following topics in this chapter.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Authentication</li>\n\t<li>One Time passwords</li>\n\t<li>Program Threats</li>\n\t<li>System Threats</li>\n\t<li>Computer Security Classifications</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\n\n<p>Authentication refers to identifying each user of the system and associating the executing programs with those users. It is the responsibility of the Operating System to create a protection system which ensures that a user who is running a particular program is authentic. Operating Systems generally identifies/authenticates users using following three ways &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Username / Password</b> &minus; User need to enter a registered username and password with Operating system to login into the system.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>User card/key</b> &minus; User need to punch card in card slot, or enter key generated by key generator in option provided by operating system to login into the system.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>User attribute - fingerprint/ eye retina pattern/ signature</b> &minus; User need to pass his/her attribute via designated input device used by operating system to login into the system.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>One Time passwords</h2>\n\n<p>One-time passwords provide additional security along with normal authentication. In One-Time Password system, a unique password is required every time user tries to login into the system. Once a one-time password is used, then it cannot be used again. One-time password are implemented in various ways.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Random numbers</b> &minus; Users are provided cards having numbers printed along with corresponding alphabets.

It is harder to detect.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Virus</b> &minus; Virus as name suggest can replicate themselves on computer system. They are highly dangerous and can modify/delete user files, crash systems. A virus is generatlly a small code embedded in a program. As user accesses the program, the virus starts getting embedded in other files/ programs and can make system unusable for user</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>System Threats</h2>\n\n<p>System threats refers to misuse of system services and network connections to put user in trouble. System threats can be used to launch program threats on a complete network called as program attack. System threats creates such an environment that operating system resources/ user files are misused. Following is the list of some well-known system threats.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Worm</b> &minus; Worm is a process which can choked down a system performance by using system resources to extreme levels. A Worm process generates its multiple copies where each copy uses system resources, prevents all other processes to get required resources. Worms processes can even shut down an entire network.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Port Scanning</b> &minus; Port scanning is a mechanism or means by which a hacker can detects system vulnerabilities to make an attack on the system.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Denial of Service</b> &minus; Denial of service attacks normally prevents user to make legitimate use of the system.

This code represents a single process, executes in single address space and do not require any context switch and hence is very efficient and fast. Kernel runs each processes and provides system services to processes, provides protected access to hardware to processes.</p>\n\n<p>Support code which is not required to run in kernel mode is in System Library. User programs and other system programs works in <b>User Mode</b> which has no access to system hardware and kernel code. User programs/ utilities use System libraries to access Kernel functions to get system&#39;s low level tasks.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic Features</h2>\n\n<p>Following are some of the important features of Linux Operating System.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Portable</b> &minus; Portability means software can works on different types of hardware in same way.

With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.</p>\n\n<p>The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be <b>Write Once, Run Anywhere.</b></p>\n\n<p>Java is &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Object Oriented</b> &minus; In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Platform Independent</b> &minus; Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Simple</b> &minus; Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Secure</b> &minus; With Java&#39;s secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Architecture-neutral</b> &minus; Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Portable</b> &minus; Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Robust</b> &minus; Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Multithreaded</b> &minus; With Java&#39;s multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Interpreted</b> &minus; Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>High Performance</b> &minus; With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Distributed</b> &minus; Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Dynamic</b> &minus; Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>History of Java</h2>\n\n<p>James Gosling initiated Java language project in June 1991 for use in one of his many set-top box projects. The language, initially called &lsquo;Oak&rsquo; after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling&#39;s office, also went by the name &lsquo;Green&rsquo; and ended up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words.</p>\n\n<p>Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised <b>Write Once, Run Anywhere</b> (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms.</p>\n\n<p>On 13 November, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>\n\n<p>On 8 May, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java&#39;s core code free and open-source, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.</p>\n\n<h2>Tools You Will Need</h2>\n\n<p>For performing the examples discussed in this tutorial, you will need a Pentium 200-MHz computer with a minimum of 64 MB of RAM (128 MB of RAM recommended).</p>\n\n<p>You will also need the following softwares &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Linux 7.1 or Windows xp/7/8 operating system</li>\n\t<li>Java JDK 8</li>\n\t<li>Microsoft Notepad or any other text editor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This tutorial will provide the necessary skills to create GUI, networking, and web applications using Java.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Next?</h2>\n\n<p>The next chapter will guide you to how you can obtain Java and its documentation.

If several words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word&#39;s first letter should be in Upper Case.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Example:</b> <i>class MyFirstJavaClass</i></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Method Names</b> &minus; All method names should start with a Lower Case letter. If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word&#39;s first letter should be in Upper Case.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Example:</b> <i>public void myMethodName()</i></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Program File Name</b> &minus; Name of the program file should exactly match the class name.</p>\n\n\t<p>When saving the file, you should save it using the class name (Remember Java is case sensitive) and append &#39;.java&#39; to the end of the name (if the file name and the class name do not match, your program will not compile).</p>\n\n\t<p>But please make a note that in case you do not have a public class present in the file then file name can be different than class name. It is also not mandatory to have a public class in the file.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Example:</b> Assume &#39;MyFirstJavaProgram&#39; is the class name. Then the file should be saved as <i>&#39;MyFirstJavaProgram.java&#39;</i></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>public static void main(String args[])</b> &minus; Java program processing starts from the main() method which is a mandatory part of every Java program.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Java Identifiers</h2>\n\n<p>All Java components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called <b>identifiers</b>.</p>\n\n<p>In Java, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A key word cannot be used as an identifier.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Java Modifiers</h2>\n\n<p>Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes, methods, etc., by using modifiers. There are two categories of modifiers &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Access Modifiers</b> &minus; default, public , protected, private</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Non-access Modifiers</b> &minus; final, abstract, strictfp</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will be looking into more details about modifiers in the next section.</p>\n\n<h2>Java Variables</h2>\n\n<p>Following are the types of variables in Java &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Local Variables</li>\n\t<li>Class Variables (Static Variables)</li>\n\t<li>Instance Variables (Non-static Variables)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Java Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct, and initialize in the upcoming chapters.</p>\n\n<h2>Java Enums</h2>\n\n<p>Enums were introduced in Java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.</p>\n\n<p>With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop, it would be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium, and large. This would make sure that it would not allow anyone to order any size other than small, medium, or large.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\" href=\"http://tpcg.io/VNJ9DE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Live Demo</a></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">class</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuice</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">enum</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuiceSize</span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\"> SMALL</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> MEDIUM</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> LARGE </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuiceSize</span><span class=\"pln\"> size</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">class</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuiceTest</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">static</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> main</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> args</span><span class=\"pun\">[])</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuice</span><span class=\"pln\"> juice </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">new</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuice</span><span class=\"pun\">();</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      juice</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">size </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuice</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"typ\">FreshJuiceSize</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">MEDIUM </span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"typ\">System</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"kwd\">out</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">println</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">&quot;Size: &quot;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"pln\"> juice</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">size</span><span class=\"pun\">);</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<p>The above example will produce the following result &minus;</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nSize: MEDIUM\n</pre>\n\n<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Enums can be declared as their own or inside a class.

Basically, if you need to create a new class and here is already a class that has some of the code you require, then it is possible to derive your new class from the already existing code.</p>\n\n<p>This concept allows you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to rewrite the code in a new class. In this scenario, the existing class is called the <b>superclass</b> and the derived class is called the <b>subclass</b>.</p>\n\n<h2>Interfaces</h2>\n\n<p>In Java language, an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to communicate with each other. Interfaces play a vital role when it comes to the concept of inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>An interface defines the methods, a deriving class (subclass) should use. But the implementation of the methods is totally up to the subclass.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Next?</h2>\n\n<p>The next section explains about Objects and classes in Java programming. At the end of the session, you will be able to get a clear picture as to what are objects and what are classes in Java.</p>\n"

            "<h2>Java - Object and Classes</h2>\n\n<p>ava is an Object-Oriented Language. As a language that has the Object-Oriented feature, Java supports the following fundamental concepts &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Polymorphism</li>\n\t<li>Inheritance</li>\n\t<li>Encapsulation</li>\n\t<li>Abstraction</li>\n\t<li>Classes</li>\n\t<li>Objects</li>\n\t<li>Instance</li>\n\t<li>Method</li>\n\t<li>Message Passing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this chapter, we will look into the concepts - Classes and Objects.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Object</b> &minus; Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors &ndash; wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Class</b> &minus; A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Objects in Java</h2>\n\n<p>Let us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, etc. All these objects have a state and a behavior.</p>\n\n<p>If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging the tail, running.</p>\n\n<p>If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>Software objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object&#39;s state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.</p>\n\n<p>So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.</p>\n\n<h2>Classes in Java</h2>\n\n<p>A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.</p>\n\n<p>Following is a sample of a class.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">class</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Dog</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> breed</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> age</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> color</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> barking</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> hungry</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> sleeping</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<p>A class can contain any of the following variable types.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Local variables</b> &minus; Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Instance variables</b> &minus; Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are initialized when the class is instantiated. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Class variables</b> &minus; Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods. In the above example, barking(), hungry() and sleeping() are methods.</p>\n\n<p>Following are some of the important topics that need to be discussed when looking into classes of the Java Language.</p>\n\n<h2>Constructors</h2>\n\n<p>When discussing about classes, one of the most important sub topic would be constructors. Every class has a constructor. If we do not explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.</p>\n\n<p>Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.</p>\n\n<p>Following is an example of a constructor &minus;</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">class</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Puppy</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Puppy</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Puppy</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> name</span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"com\">// This constructor has one parameter, </span><i><span class=\"com\">name</span></i><span class=\"com\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<p>Java also supports <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_using_singleton.htm\">Singleton Classes</a> where you would be able to create only one instance of a class.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note</b> &minus; We have two different types of constructors. We are going to discuss constructors in detail in the subsequent chapters.</p>\n\n<h2>Creating an Object</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned previously, a class provides the blueprints for objects. So basically, an object is created from a class. In Java, the new keyword is used to create new objects.</p>\n\n<p>There are three steps when creating an object from a class &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Declaration</b> &minus; A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Instantiation</b> &minus; The &#39;new&#39; keyword is used to create the object.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Initialization</b> &minus; The &#39;new&#39; keyword is followed by a call to a constructor.

source file declaration rules. These rules are essential when declaring classes, <i>import</i> statements and <i>package</i> statements in a source file.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>There can be only one public class per source file.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A source file can have multiple non-public classes.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The public class name should be the name of the source file as well which should be appended by <b>.java</b> at the end. For example: the class name is <i>public class Employee{}</i> then the source file should be as Employee.java.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If the class is defined inside a package, then the package statement should be the first statement in the source file.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If import statements are present, then they must be written between the package statement and the class declaration. If there are no package statements, then the import statement should be the first line in the source file.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Import and package statements will imply to all the classes present in the source file. It is not possible to declare different import and/or package statements to different classes in the source file.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Classes have several access levels and there are different types of classes; abstract classes, final classes, etc. We will be explaining about all these in the access modifiers chapter.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the above mentioned types of classes, Java also has some special classes called Inner classes and Anonymous classes.</p>\n\n<h2>Java Package</h2>\n\n<p>In simple words, it is a way of categorizing the classes and interfaces. When developing applications in Java, hundreds of classes and interfaces will be written, therefore categorizing these classes is a must as well as makes life much easier.</p>\n\n<h2>Import Statements</h2>\n\n<p>In Java if a fully qualified name, which includes the package and the class name is given, then the compiler can easily locate the source code or classes. Import statement is a way of giving the proper location for the compiler to find that particular class.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the following line would ask the compiler to load all the classes available in directory java_installation/java/io &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nimport java.io.*;\n</pre>\n\n<h2>A Simple Case Study</h2>\n\n<p>For our case study, we will be creating two classes. They are Employee and EmployeeTest.</p>\n\n<p>First open notepad and add the following code. Remember this is the Employee class and the class is a public class. Now, save this source file with the name Employee.java.</p>\n\n<p>The Employee class has four instance variables - name, age, designation and salary. The class has one explicitly defined constructor, which takes a parameter.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span

            "<h2>Java - Constructors</h2>\n\n<p>A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. However, constructors have no explicit return type.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.</p>\n\n<p>All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes all member variables to zero.

            "<h1>Java - Arrays</h1>\n\n<p>Java provides a data structure, the <b>array</b>, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables.</p>\n\n<p>This tutorial introduces how to declare array variables, create arrays, and process arrays using indexed variables.</p>\n\n<h2>Declaring Array Variables</h2>\n\n<p>To use an array in a program, you must declare a variable to reference the array, and you must specify the type of array the variable can reference. Here is the syntax for declaring an array variable &minus;</p>\n\n<h3>Syntax</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ndataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.\nor\ndataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.\n</pre>\n\n<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The style <b>dataType[] arrayRefVar</b> is preferred. The style <b>dataType arrayRefVar[]</b> comes from the C/C++ language and was adopted in Java to accommodate C/C++ programmers.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>The following code snippets are examples of this syntax &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">double</span><span class=\"pun\">[]</span><span class=\"pln\"> myList</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">   </span><span class=\"com\">// preferred way.</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">or</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">double</span><span class=\"pln\"> myList</span><span class=\"pun\">[];</span><span class=\"pln\">   </span><span class=\"com\">// works but not preferred way.</span></pre>\n\n<h2>Creating Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>You can create an array by using the new operator with the following syntax &minus;</p>\n\n<h3>Syntax</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\narrayRefVar = new dataType[arraySize];\n</pre>\n\n<p>The above statement does two things &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>It creates an array using new dataType[arraySize].</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>It assigns the reference of the newly created array to the variable arrayRefVar.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Declaring an array variable, creating an array, and assigning the reference of the array to the variable can be combined in one statement, as shown below &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ndataType[] arrayRefVar = new dataType[arraySize];\n</pre>\n\n<p>Alternatively you can create arrays as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\ndataType[] arrayRefVar = {value0, value1, ..., valuek};\n</pre>\n\n<p>The array elements are accessed through the <b>index</b>. Array indices are 0-based; that is, they start from 0 to <b>arrayRefVar.length-1</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Following statement declares an array variable, myList, creates an array of 10 elements of double type and assigns its reference to myList &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">double</span><span class=\"pun\">[]</span><span class=\"pln\"> myList </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">new</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">double</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"lit\">10</span><span class=\"pun\">];</span></pre>\n\n<p>Following picture represents array myList. Here, myList holds ten double values and the indices are from 0 to 9.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Java Array\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/images/java_array.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Processing Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>When processing array elements, we often use either <b>for</b> loop or <b>foreach</b> loop because all of the elements in an array are of the same type and the size of the array is known.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Here is a complete example showing how to create, initialize, and process arrays &minus;</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"demo\" href=\"http://tpcg.io/aXdX5u\"

            "<h1>Java - Inheritance</h1>\n\n<p>Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.</p>\n\n<p>The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).</p>\n\n<h2>extends Keyword</h2>\n\n<p><b>extends</b> is the keyword used to inherit the properties of a class. Following is the syntax of extends keyword.</p>\n\n<p><b>Syntax</b></p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nclass Super {\n   .....\n   .....\n}\nclass Sub extends Super {\n   .....\n   .....\n}\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Sample Code</h2>\n\n<p>Following is an example demonstrating Java inheritance. In this example, you can observe two classes namely Calculation and My_Calculation.</p>\n\n<p>Using extends keyword, the My_Calculation inherits the methods addition() and Subtraction() of Calculation

To achieve this, the Van class hides the implementation details from the users of the Van class.

            "<h1>Java - Polymorphism</h1>\n\n<p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.</p>\n\n<p>Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their own type and for the class Object.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to know that the only possible way to access an object is through a reference variable. A reference variable can be of only one type. Once declared, the type of a reference variable cannot be changed.</p>\n\n<p>The reference variable can be reassigned to other objects provided that it is not declared final. The type of the reference variable would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object.</p>\n\n<p>A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type. A reference variable can be declared as a class or interface type.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Let us look at an example.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">interface</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Vegetarian</span><span class=\"pun\">{}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">class</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Animal</span><span class=\"pun\">{}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">class</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Deer</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">extends</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Animal</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">implements</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Vegetarian</span><span class=\"pun\">{}</span></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the Deer class is considered to be polymorphic since this has multiple inheritance.

An overridden method is essentially hidden in the parent class, and is not invoked unless the child class uses the super keyword within the overriding method.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre

            "<h1>Java - Abstraction</h1>\n\n<p>As per dictionary, <b>abstraction</b> is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. For example, when you consider the case of e-mail, complex details such as what happens as soon as you send an e-mail, the protocol your e-mail server uses are hidden from the user. Therefore, to send an e-mail you just need to type the content, mention the address of the receiver, and click send.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise in Object-oriented programming, abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.</p>\n\n<p>In Java, abstraction is achieved using Abstract classes and interfaces.</p>\n\n<h2>Abstract Class</h2>\n\n<p>A class which contains the <b>abstract</b> keyword in its declaration is known as abstract class.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Abstract classes may or may not contain <i>abstract methods</i>, i.e., methods without body ( public void get(); )</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class <b>must</b> be declared abstract.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations to the abstract methods in it.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>This section provides you an example of the abstract class. To create an abstract class, just use the <b>abstract</b> keyword before the class keyword, in the class declaration.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"com\">/* File name : Employee.java */</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">abstract</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">class</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Employee</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">private</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> name</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">private</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> address</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">private</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> number</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">Employee</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> name</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">String</span><span class=\"pln\"> address</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> number</span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"typ\">System</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"kwd\">out</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">println</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">&quot;Constructing an Employee&quot;</span><span class=\"pun\">);</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">this</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">name </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> name</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">this</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">address </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> address</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">this</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">number </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> number</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">double</span><span class=\"pln\"> computePay</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n     </span><span class=\"typ\">System</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"kwd\">out</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">println</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">&quot;Inside Employee computePay&quot;</span><span class=\"pun\">);</span><span class=\"pln\">\n     </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0.0</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"pun\">}</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">public</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">void</span><span class=\"pln\"> mailCheck</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"typ\">System</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"kwd\">out</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">println</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"str\">&quot;Mailing a check to &quot;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">this</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">name </span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"str\">&quot;

A class that implements a tagging interface does not need to define any methods (since the interface does not have any), but the class becomes an interface type through polymorphism.</p>\n"

            "<h1>Java - Packages</h1>\n\n<p>Packages are used in Java in order to prevent naming conflicts, to control access, to make searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier, etc.</p>\n\n<p>A <b>Package</b> can be defined as a grouping of related types (classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations ) providing access protection and namespace management.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the existing packages in Java are &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>java.lang</b> &minus; bundles the fundamental classes</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>java.io</b> &minus; classes for input , output functions are bundled in this package</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Programmers can define their own packages to bundle group of classes/interfaces, etc. It is a good practice to group related classes implemented by you so that a programmer can easily determine that the classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotations are related.</p>\n\n<p>Since the package creates a new namespace there won&#39;t be any name conflicts with names in other packages. Using packages, it is easier to provide access control and it is also easier to locate the related classes.</p>\n\n<h2>Creating a Package</h2>\n\n<p>While creating a package, you should choose a name for the package and include a <b>package</b> statement along with that name at the top of every source file that contains the classes, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types that you want to include in the package.</p>\n\n<p>The package statement should be the first line in the source file. There can be only one package statement in each source file, and it applies to all types in the file.</p>\n\n<p>If a package statement is not used then the class, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types will be placed in the current default package.</p>\n\n<p>To compile the Java programs with package statements, you have to use -d option as shown below.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\njavac -d Destination_folder file_name.java</pre>\n\n<p>Then a folder with the given package name is created in the specified destination, and the compiled class files will be placed in that folder.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Let us look at an example that creates a package called <b>animals</b>.

Following terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Interface</b> &minus; Each data structure has an interface. Interface represents the set of operations that a data structure supports. An interface only provides the list of supported operations, type of parameters they can accept and return type of these operations.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Implementation</b> &minus; Implementation provides the internal representation of a data structure. Implementation also provides the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Characteristics of a Data Structure</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Correctness</b> &minus; Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Time Complexity</b> &minus; Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Space Complexity</b> &minus; Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Need for Data Structure</h2>\n\n<p>As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Data Search</b> &minus; Consider an inventory of 1 million(10<sup>6</sup>) items of a store. If the application is to search an item, it has to search an item in 1 million(10<sup>6</sup>) items every time slowing down the search.

Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.</p>\n\n<h2>Execution Time Cases</h2>\n\n<p>There are three cases which are usually used to compare various data structure&#39;s execution time in a relative manner.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Worst Case</b> &minus; This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation takes maximum time it can take.

Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.</p>\n\n<p>From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Search</b> &minus; Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Sort</b> &minus; Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Insert</b> &minus; Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Update</b> &minus; Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Delete</b> &minus; Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Characteristics of an Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>Not all procedures can be called an algorithm. An algorithm should have the following characteristics &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Unambiguous</b> &minus; Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Input</b> &minus; An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Output</b> &minus; An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Finiteness</b> &minus; Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Feasibility</b> &minus; Should be feasible with the available resources.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Independent</b> &minus; An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Write an Algorithm?</h2>\n\n<p>There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and resource dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code.</p>\n\n<p>As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (do, for, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used to write an algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>We write algorithms in a step-by-step manner, but it is not always the case. Algorithm writing is a process and is executed after the problem domain is well-defined. That is, we should know the problem domain, for which we are designing a solution.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s try to learn algorithm-writing by using an example.</p>\n\n<p><b>Problem</b> &minus; Design an algorithm to add two numbers and display the result.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<b>Step 1</b> &minus; START\n<b>Step 2</b> &minus; declare three integers <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> &amp; <b>c</b>\n<b>Step 3</b> &minus; define values of <b>a</b> &amp; <b>b</b>\n<b>Step 4</b> &minus; add values of <b>a</b> &amp; <b>b</b>\n<b>Step 5</b> &minus; store output of <u>step 4</u> to <b>c</b>\n<b>Step 6</b> &minus; print <b>c</b>\n<b>Step 7</b> &minus; STOP\n</pre>\n\n<p>Algorithms tell the programmers how to code the program. Alternatively, the algorithm can be written as &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<b>Step 1</b> &minus; START ADD\n<b>Step 2</b> &minus; get values of <b>a</b> &amp; <b>b</b>\n<b>Step 3</b> &minus; c &larr; a + b\n<b>Step 4</b> &minus; display c\n<b>Step 5</b> &minus; STOP\n</pre>\n\n<p>In design and analysis of algorithms, usually the second method is used to describe an algorithm. It makes it easy for the analyst to analyze the algorithm ignoring all unwanted definitions. He can observe what operations are being used and how the process is flowing.</p>\n\n<p>Writing <b>step numbers</b>, is optional.</p>\n\n<p>We design an algorithm to get a solution of a given problem. A problem can be solved in more than one ways.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"one problem many solutions\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/problem_solutions.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Hence, many solution algorithms can be derived for a given problem. The next step is to analyze those proposed solution algorithms and implement the best suitable solution.</p>\n\n<h2>Algorithm Analysis</h2>\n\n<p>Efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages, before implementation and after implementation. They are the following &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b><i>A Priori</i> Analysis</b> &minus; This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b><i>A Posterior</i> Analysis</b> &minus; This is an empirical analysis of an algorithm. The selected algorithm is implemented using programming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We shall learn about <i>a priori</i> algorithm analysis. Algorithm analysis deals with the execution or running time of various operations involved. The running time of an operation can be defined as the number of computer instructions executed per operation.</p>\n\n<h2>Algorithm Complexity</h2>\n\n<p>Suppose <b>X</b> is an algorithm and <b>n</b> is the size of input data, the time and space used by the algorithm X are the two main factors, which decide the efficiency of X.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Time Factor</b> &minus; Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Space Factor</b> &minus; Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The complexity of an algorithm <b>f(n)</b> gives the running time and/or the storage space required by the algorithm in terms of <b>n</b> as the size of input data.</p>\n\n<h2>Space Complexity</h2>\n\n<p>Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of memory space required by the algorithm in its life cycle. The space required by an algorithm is equal to the sum of the following two components &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A fixed part that is a space required to store certain data and variables, that are independent of the size of the problem. For example, simple variables and constants used, program size, etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>A variable part is a space required by variables, whose size depends on the size of the problem. For example, dynamic memory allocation, recursion stack space, etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Space complexity S(P) of any algorithm P is S(P) = C + SP(I), where C is the fixed part and S(I) is the variable part of the algorithm, which depends on instance characteristic I. Following is a simple example that tries to explain the concept &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nAlgorithm: SUM(A, B)\nStep 1 -  START\nStep 2 -  C &larr; A + B + 10\nStep 3 -  Stop\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here we have three variables A, B, and C and one constant. Hence S(P) = 1 + 3. Now, space depends on data types of given variables and constant types and it will be multiplied accordingly.</p>\n\n<h2>Time Complexity</h2>\n\n<p>Time complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of time required by the algorithm to run to completion. Time requirements can be defined as a numerical function T(n), where T(n) can be measured as the number of steps, provided each step consumes constant time.</p>\n\n<p>For example, addition of two n-bit integers takes <b>n</b> steps. Consequently, the total computational time is T(n) = c &lowast; n, where c is the time taken for the addition of two bits. Here, we observe that T(n) grows linearly as the input size increases.</p>\n\n<hr />"

            "<h1>Data Structures - Dynamic Programming</h1>\n\n<p>Dynamic programming approach is similar to divide and conquer in breaking down the problem into smaller and yet smaller possible sub-problems. But unlike, divide and conquer, these sub-problems are not solved independently. Rather, results of these smaller sub-problems are remembered and used for similar or overlapping sub-problems.</p>\n\n<p>Dynamic programming is used where we have problems, which can be divided into similar sub-problems, so that their results can be re-used. Mostly, these algorithms are used for optimization. Before solving the in-hand sub-problem, dynamic algorithm will try to examine the results of the previously solved sub-problems. The solutions of sub-problems are combined in order to achieve the best solution.</p>\n\n<p>So we can say that &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The problem should be able to be divided into smaller overlapping sub-problem.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>An optimum solution can be achieved by using an optimum solution of smaller sub-problems.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Dynamic algorithms use Memoization.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Comparison</h2>\n\n<p>In contrast to greedy algorithms, where local optimization is addressed, dynamic algorithms are motivated for an overall optimization of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to divide and conquer algorithms, where solutions are combined to achieve an overall solution, dynamic algorithms use the output of a smaller sub-problem and then try to optimize a bigger sub-problem. Dynamic algorithms use Memoization to remember the output of already solved sub-problems.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>The following computer problems can be solved using dynamic programming approach &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Fibonacci number series</li>\n\t<li>Knapsack problem</li>\n\t<li>Tower of Hanoi</li>\n\t<li>All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall</li>\n\t<li>Shortest path by Dijkstra</li>\n\t<li>Project scheduling</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dynamic programming can be used in both top-down and bottom-up manner.

            "<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms - Linked List</h1>\n\n<p>A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.</p>\n\n<p>Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Link</b> &minus; Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Next</b> &minus; Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>LinkedList</b> &minus; A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Linked List Representation</h2>\n\n<p>Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>As per the above illustration, following are the important points to be considered.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Linked List contains a link element called first.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Each link carries a data field(s) and a link field called next.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Each link is linked with its next link using its next link.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Last link carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Types of Linked List</h2>\n\n<p>Following are the various types of linked list.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Simple Linked List</b> &minus; Item navigation is forward only.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Doubly Linked List</b> &minus; Items can be navigated forward and backward.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Circular Linked List</b> &minus; Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Basic Operations</h2>\n\n<p>Following are the basic operations supported by a list.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Insertion</b> &minus; Adds an element at the beginning of the list.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Deletion</b> &minus; Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Display</b> &minus; Displays the complete list.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Search</b> &minus; Searches an element using the given key.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>Delete</b> &minus; Deletes an element using the given key.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Insertion Operation</h2>\n\n<p>Adding a new node in linked list is a more than one step activity. We shall learn this with diagrams here. First, create a node using the same structure and find the location where it has to be inserted.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Insertion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_insertion_0.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Imagine that we are inserting a node <b>B</b> (NewNode), between <b>A</b> (LeftNode) and <b>C</b> (RightNode). Then point B.next to C &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nNewNode.next &minus;&gt; RightNode;\n</pre>\n\n<p>It should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Insertion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_insertion_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now, the next node at the left should point to the new node.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nLeftNode.next &minus;&gt; NewNode;\n</pre>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Insertion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_insertion_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>This will put the new node in the middle of the two. The new list should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Insertion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_insertion_3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Similar steps should be taken if the node is being inserted at the beginning of the list. While inserting it at the end, the second last node of the list should point to the new node and the new node will point to NULL.</p>\n\n<h2>Deletion Operation</h2>\n\n<p>Deletion is also a more than one step process. We shall learn with pictorial representation. First, locate the target node to be removed, by using searching algorithms.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Deletion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_deletion_0.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The left (previous) node of the target node now should point to the next node of the target node &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nLeftNode.next &minus;&gt; TargetNode.next;\n</pre>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Deletion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_deletion_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>This will remove the link that was pointing to the target node. Now, using the following code, we will remove what the target node is pointing at.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nTargetNode.next &minus;&gt; NULL;\n</pre>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Deletion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_deletion_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We need to use the deleted node. We can keep that in memory otherwise we can simply deallocate memory and wipe off the target node completely.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Deletion\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_deletion_3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Reverse Operation</h2>\n\n<p>This operation is a thorough one. We need to make the last node to be pointed by the head node and reverse the whole linked list.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Reverse Operation\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_reverse_0.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>First, we traverse to the end of the list. It should be pointing to NULL. Now, we shall make it point to its previous node &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Reverse Operation\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_reverse_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We have to make sure that the last node is not the lost node. So we&#39;ll have some temp node, which looks like the head node pointing to the last node. Now, we shall make all left side nodes point to their previous nodes one by one.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Reverse Operation\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_reverse_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Except the node (first node) pointed by the head node, all nodes should point to their predecessor, making them their new successor. The first node will point to NULL.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Reverse Operation\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_reverse_3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We&#39;ll make the head node point to the new first node by using the temp node.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Linked List Reverse Operation\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linked_list_reverse_4.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The linked list is now reversed.

            "<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms - Stack</h1>\n\n<p>A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example &ndash; a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Stack Example\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/stack_example.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>A real-world stack allows operations at one end only. For example, we can place or remove a card or plate from the top of the stack only. Likewise, Stack ADT allows all data operations at one end only. At any given time, we can only access the top element of a stack.</p>\n\n<p>This feature makes it LIFO data structure. LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first. In stack terminology, insertion operation is called <b>PUSH</b> operation and removal operation is called <b>POP</b> operation.</p>\n\n<h2>Stack Representation</h2>\n\n<p>The following diagram depicts a stack and its operations &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Stack Representation\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/stack_representation.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>A stack can be implemented by means of Array, Structure, Pointer, and Linked List. Stack can either be a fixed size one or it may have a sense of dynamic resizing. Here, we are going to implement stack using arrays, which makes it a fixed size stack implementation.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic Operations</h2>\n\n<p>Stack operations may involve initializing the stack, using it and then de-initializing it. Apart from these basic stuffs, a stack is used for the following two primary operations &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>push()</b> &minus; Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>pop()</b> &minus; Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When data is PUSHed onto stack.</p>\n\n<p>To use a stack efficiently, we need to check the status of stack as well. For the same purpose, the following functionality is added to stacks &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>peek()</b> &minus; get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>isFull()</b> &minus; check if stack is full.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><b>isEmpty()</b> &minus; check if stack is empty.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At all times, we maintain a pointer to the last PUSHed data on the stack. As this pointer always represents the top of the stack, hence named <b>top</b>. The <b>top</b> pointer provides top value of the stack without actually removing it.</p>\n\n<p>First we should learn about procedures to support stack functions &minus;</p>\n\n<h3>peek()</h3>\n\n<p>Algorithm of peek() function &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nbegin procedure peek\n   return stack[top]\nend procedure\n</pre>\n\n<p>Implementation of peek() function in C programming language &minus;</p>\n\n<p><b>Example</b></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">int</span><span class=\"pln\"> peek</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> stack</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">top</span><span class=\"pun\">];</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<h3>isfull()</h3>\n\n<p>Algorithm of isfull() function &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">begin</span><span class=\"pln\"> procedure isfull\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> top equals to MAXSIZE\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">true</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">else</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">false</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   endif\n   \n</span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> procedure</span></pre>\n\n<p>Implementation of isfull() function in C programming language &minus;</p>\n\n<p><b>Example</b></p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">bool</span><span class=\"pln\"> isfull</span><span class=\"pun\">()</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">{</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\">top </span><span class=\"pun\">==</span><span class=\"pln\"> MAXSIZE</span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">true</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">else</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">false</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n</span><span class=\"pun\">}</span></pre>\n\n<h3>isempty()</h3>\n\n<p>Algorithm of isempty() function &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">begin</span><span class=\"pln\"> procedure isempty\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> top less than </span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">true</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">else</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">false</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   endif\n   \n</span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> procedure</span></pre>\n\n<p>Implementation of isempty() function in C programming language is slightly different.

            "<h1>Data Structure - Expression Parsing</h1>\n\n<p>The way to write arithmetic expression is known as a <b>notation</b>. An arithmetic expression can be written in three different but equivalent notations, i.e., without changing the essence or output of an expression. These notations are &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Infix Notation</li>\n\t<li>Prefix (Polish) Notation</li>\n\t<li>Postfix (Reverse-Polish) Notation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These notations are named as how they use operator in expression. We shall learn the same here in this chapter.</p>\n\n<h2>Infix Notation</h2>\n\n<p>We write expression in <b>infix</b> notation, e.g. a - b + c, where operators are used <b>in</b>-between operands. It is easy for us humans to read, write, and speak in infix notation but the same does not go well with computing devices. An algorithm to process infix notation could be difficult and costly in terms of time and space consumption.</p>\n\n<h2>Prefix Notation</h2>\n\n<p>In this notation, operator is <b>prefix</b>ed to operands, i.e. operator is written ahead of operands. For example, <b>+ab</b>. This is equivalent to its infix notation <b>a + b</b>. Prefix notation is also known as <b>Polish Notation</b>.</p>\n\n<h2>Postfix Notation</h2>\n\n<p>This notation style is known as <b>Reversed Polish Notation</b>. In this notation style, the operator is <b>postfix</b>ed to the operands i.e., the operator is written after the operands. For example, <b>ab+</b>. This is equivalent to its infix notation <b>a + b</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The following table briefly tries to show the difference in all three notations &minus;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Sr.No.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Infix Notation</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Prefix Notation</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Postfix Notation</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a + b</td>\n\t\t\t<td>+ a b</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a b +</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>(a + b) &lowast; c</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&lowast; + a b c</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a b + c &lowast;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a &lowast; (b + c)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&lowast; a + b c</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a b c + &lowast;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a / b + c / d</td>\n\t\t\t<td>+ / a b / c d</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a b / c d / +</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>(a + b) &lowast; (c + d)</td>\n\t\t\t<td>&lowast; + a b + c d</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a b + c d + &lowast;</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t<td>((a + b) &lowast; c) - d</td>\n\t\t\t<td>- &lowast; + a b c d</td>\n\t\t\t<td>a b + c &lowast; d -</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Parsing Expressions</h2>\n\n<p>As we have discussed, it is not a very efficient way to design an algorithm or program to parse infix notations. Instead, these infix notations are first converted into either postfix or prefix notations and then computed.</p>\n\n<p>To parse any arithmetic expression, we need to take care of operator precedence and associativity also.</p>\n\n<h3>Precedence</h3>\n\n<p>When an operand is in between two different operators, which operator will take the operand first, is decided by the precedence of an operator over others. For example &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Operator Precendence\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/operator_precedence.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>As multiplication operation has precedence over addition, b * c will be evaluated first. A table of operator precedence is provided later.</p>\n\n<h3>Associativity</h3>\n\n<p>Associativity describes the rule where operators with the same precedence appear in an expression. For example, in expression a + b &minus; c, both + and &ndash; have the same precedence, then which part of the expression will be evaluated first, is determined by associativity of those operators. Here, both + and &minus; are left associative, so the expression will be evaluated as <b>(a + b) &minus; c</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Precedence and associativity determines the order of evaluation of an expression. Following is an operator precedence and associativity table (highest to lowest) &minus;</p>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Sr.No.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Operator</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Precedence</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Associativity</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Exponentiation ^</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Highest</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Right Associative</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Multiplication ( &lowast; ) &amp; Division ( / )</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Second Highest</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Left Associative</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Addition ( + ) &amp; Subtraction ( &minus; )</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Lowest</td>\n\t\t\t<td>Left Associative</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The above table shows the default behavior of operators. At any point of time in expression evaluation, the order can be altered by using parenthesis. For example &minus;</p>\n\n<p>In <b>a + b*c</b>, the expression part <b>b</b>*<b>c</b> will be evaluated first, with multiplication as precedence over addition. We here use parenthesis for <b>a + b</b> to be evaluated first, like <b>(a + b)*c</b>.</p>\n\n<h2>Postfix Evaluation Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>We shall now look at the algorithm on how to evaluate postfix notation &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nStep 1 &minus; scan the expression from left to right \nStep 2 &minus; if it is an operand push it to stack \nStep 3 &minus; if it is an operator pull operand from stack and perform operation \nStep 4 &minus; store the output of step 3, back to stack \nStep 5 &minus; scan the expression until all operands are consumed \nStep 6 &minus; pop the stack and perform operation\n</pre>\n\n<p>To see the implementation in C programming language, please <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/expression_parsing_using_statck.htm\">click here</a>.</p>\n"

            "<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms Binary Search</h1>\n\n<p>Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of &Omicron;(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.</p>\n\n<p>Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.</p>\n\n<h2>How Binary Search Works?</h2>\n\n<p>For a binary search to work, it is mandatory for the target array to be sorted. We shall learn the process of binary search with a pictorial example. The following is our sorted array and let us assume that we need to search the location of value 31 using binary search.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Binary search\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_0.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>First, we shall determine half of the array by using this formula &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nmid = low + (high - low) / 2\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here it is, 0 + (9 - 0 ) / 2 = 4 (integer value of 4.5). So, 4 is the mid of the array.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Binary search\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now we compare the value stored at location 4, with the value being searched, i.e. 31. We find that the value at location 4 is 27, which is not a match. As the value is greater than 27 and we have a sorted array, so we also know that the target value must be in the upper portion of the array.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Binary search\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We change our low to mid + 1 and find the new mid value again.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nlow = mid + 1\nmid = low + (high - low) / 2\n</pre>\n\n<p>Our new mid is 7 now. We compare the value stored at location 7 with our target value 31.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Binary search\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The value stored at location 7 is not a match, rather it is more than what we are looking for. So, the value must be in the lower part from this location.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Binary search\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_4.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Hence, we calculate the mid again. This time it is 5.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Binary search\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_5.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We compare the value stored at location 5 with our target value. We find that it is a match.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Binary search\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/binary_search_6.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We conclude that the target value 31 is stored at location 5.</p>\n\n<p>Binary search halves the searchable items and thus reduces the count of comparisons to be made to very less numbers.</p>\n\n<h2>Pseudocode</h2>\n\n<p>The pseudocode of binary search algorithms should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"typ\">Procedure</span><span class=\"pln\"> binary_search\n   A </span><span class=\"pun\">&larr;</span><span class=\"pln\"> sorted array\n   n </span><span class=\"pun\">&larr;</span><span class=\"pln\"> size of array\n   x </span><span class=\"pun\">&larr;</span><span class=\"pln\"> value to be searched\n\n   </span><span class=\"typ\">Set</span><span class=\"pln\"> lowerBound </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"typ\">Set</span><span class=\"pln\"> upperBound </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> n \n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\"> x </span><span class=\"kwd\">not</span><span class=\"pln\"> found\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> upperBound </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> lowerBound \n         EXIT</span><span class=\"pun\">:</span><span class=\"pln\"> x does </span><span class=\"kwd\">not</span><span class=\"pln\"> exists</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">set</span><span class=\"pln\"> midPoint </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> lowerBound </span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\"> upperBound </span><span class=\"pun\">-</span><span class=\"pln\"> lowerBound </span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">/</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">2</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      \n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> A</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">midPoint</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> x\n         </span><span class=\"kwd\">set</span><span class=\"pln\"> lowerBound </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> midPoint </span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pln\">\n         \n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> A</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">midPoint</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> x\n         </span><span class=\"kwd\">set</span><span class=\"pln\"> upperBound </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> midPoint </span><span class=\"pun\">-</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pln\"> \n\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> A</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">midPoint</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> x \n         EXIT</span><span class=\"pun\">:</span><span class=\"pln\"> x found at location midPoint\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n</span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> procedure</span></pre>\n\n<p>To know about binary search implementation using array in C programming language, please <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/binary_search_program_in_c.htm\">click here</a>.</p>\n"

            "<h1>Data Structure - Interpolation Search</h1>\n\n<p>Interpolation search is an improved variant of binary search. This search algorithm works on the probing position of the required value. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in a sorted form and equally distributed.</p>\n\n<p>Binary search has a huge advantage of time complexity over linear search. Linear search has worst-case complexity of &Omicron;(n) whereas binary search has &Omicron;(log n).</p>\n\n<p>There are cases where the location of target data may be known in advance. For example, in case of a telephone directory, if we want to search the telephone number of Morphius. Here, linear search and even binary search will seem slow as we can directly jump to memory space where the names start from &#39;M&#39; are stored.</p>\n\n<h2>Positioning in Binary Search</h2>\n\n<p>In binary search, if the desired data is not found then the rest of the list is divided in two parts, lower and higher.

To split the list into two parts, we use the following method &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nmid = Lo + ((Hi - Lo) / (A[Hi] - A[Lo])) * (X - A[Lo])\n\nwhere &minus;\n   A    = list\n   Lo   = Lowest index of the list\n   Hi   = Highest index of the list\n   A[n] = Value stored at index n in the list\n</pre>\n\n<p>If the middle item is greater than the item, then the probe position is again calculated in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched in the subarray to the left of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of subarray reduces to zero.</p>\n\n<p>Runtime complexity of interpolation search algorithm is <b>&Omicron;(log (log n))</b> as compared

            "<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms - Hash Table</h1>\n\n<p>Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.</p>\n\n<h2>Hashing</h2>\n\n<p>Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. We&#39;re going to use modulo operator to get a range of key values. Consider an example of hash table of size 20, and the following items are to be stored. Item are in the (key,value) format.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Hash Function\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/hash_function.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>(1,20)</li>\n\t<li>(2,70)</li>\n\t<li>(42,80)</li>\n\t<li>(4,25)</li>\n\t<li>(12,44)</li>\n\t<li>(14,32)</li>\n\t<li>(17,11)</li>\n\t<li>(13,78)</li>\n\t<li>(37,98)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\" style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Sr.No.</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Key</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Hash</th>\n\t\t\t<th style=\"text-align:center;\">Array Index</th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1 % 20 = 1</td>\n\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2 % 20 = 2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>3</td>\n\t\t\t<td>42</td>\n\t\t\t<td>42 % 20 = 2</td>\n\t\t\t<td>2</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>4 % 20 = 4</td>\n\t\t\t<td>4</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>5</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12 % 20 = 12</td>\n\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t<td>14</td>\n\t\t\t<td>14 % 20 = 14</td>\n\t\t\t<td>14</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>7</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17 % 20 = 17</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>8</td>\n\t\t\t<td>13</td>\n\t\t\t<td>13 % 20 = 13</td>\n\t\t\t<td>13</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>9</td>\n\t\t\t<td>37</td>\n\t\t\t<td>37 % 20 = 17</td>\n\t\t\t<td>17</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2>Linear Probing</h2>\n\n<p>As we can see, it may happen that the hashing technique is used to create an already used index of the array.

These algorithms do not require any extra space and sorting is said to happen in-place, or for example, within the array itself. This is called <b>in-place sorting</b>. Bubble sort is an example of in-place sorting.</p>\n\n<p>However, in some sorting algorithms, the program requires space which is more than or equal to the elements being sorted. Sorting which uses equal or more space is called <b>not-in-place sorting</b>. Merge-sort is an example of not-in-place sorting.</p>\n\n<h2>Stable and Not Stable Sorting</h2>\n\n<p>If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called <b>stable sorting</b>.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Stable Sorting\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/stable_sort.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>If a sorting algorithm, after sorting the contents, changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, it is called <b>unstable sorting</b>.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Unstable Sorting\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/unstable_sort.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Stability of an algorithm matters when we wish to maintain the sequence of original elements, like in a tuple for example.</p>\n\n<h2>Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Sorting Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>A sorting algorithm is said to be adaptive, if it takes advantage of already &#39;sorted&#39; elements in the list that is to be sorted. That is, while sorting if the source list has some element already sorted, adaptive algorithms will take this into account and will try not to re-order them.</p>\n\n<p>A non-adaptive algorithm is one which does not take into account the elements which are already sorted. They try to force every single element to be re-ordered to confirm their sortedness.</p>\n\n<h2>Important Terms</h2>\n\n<p>Some terms are generally coined while discussing sorting techniques, here is a brief introduction to them &minus;</p>\n\n<h3>Increasing Order</h3>\n\n<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>increasing order</b>, if the successive element is greater than the previous one. For example, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 are in increasing order, as every next element is greater than the previous element.</p>\n\n<h3>Decreasing Order</h3>\n\n<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>decreasing order</b>, if the successive element is less than the current one. For example, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3, 1 are in decreasing order, as every next element is less than the previous element.</p>\n\n<h3>Non-Increasing Order</h3>\n\n<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>non-increasing order</b>, if the successive element is less than or equal to its previous element in the sequence. This order occurs when the sequence contains duplicate values. For example, 9, 8, 6, 3, 3, 1 are in non-increasing order, as every next element is less than or equal to (in case of 3) but not greater than any previous element.</p>\n\n<h3>Non-Decreasing Order</h3>\n\n<p>A sequence of values is said to be in <b>non-decreasing order</b>, if the successive element is greater than or equal to its previous element in the sequence. This order occurs when the sequence contains duplicate values. For example, 1, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9 are in non-decreasing order, as every next element is greater than or equal to (in case of 3) but not less than the previous one.</p>\n\n<hr />"

            "<h1>Data Structure - Bubble Sort Algorithm</h1>\n\n<p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>) where <b>n</b> is the number of items.</p>\n\n<h2>How Bubble Sort Works?</h2>\n\n<p>We take an unsorted array for our example. Bubble sort takes &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>) time so we&#39;re keeping it short and precise.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_0.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Bubble sort starts with very first two elements, comparing them to check which one is greater.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In this case, value 33 is greater than 14, so it is already in sorted locations. Next, we compare 33 with 27.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We find that 27 is smaller than 33 and these two values must be swapped.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The new array should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_4.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Next we compare 33 and 35. We find that both are in already sorted positions.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_5.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then we move to the next two values, 35 and 10.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_6.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We know then that 10 is smaller 35. Hence they are not sorted.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_7.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We swap these values. We find that we have reached the end of the array. After one iteration, the array should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_8.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>To be precise, we are now showing how an array should look like after each iteration. After the second iteration, it should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_9.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Notice that after each iteration, at least one value moves at the end.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_10.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>And when there&#39;s no swap required, bubble sorts learns that an array is completely sorted.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Bubble Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/bubble_sort_11.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now we should look into some practical aspects of bubble sort.</p>\n\n<h2>Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>We assume <b>list</b> is an array of <b>n</b> elements. We further assume that <b>swap</b> function swaps the values of the given array elements.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">begin</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">BubbleSort</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\">list</span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">for</span><span class=\"pln\"> all elements of list\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">i</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">i</span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\">\n         swap</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\">list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">i</span><span class=\"pun\">],</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">i</span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pun\">])</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">for</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> list\n   \n</span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"typ\">BubbleSort</span></pre>\n\n<h2>Pseudocode</h2>\n\n<p>We observe in algorithm that Bubble Sort compares each pair of array element unless the whole array is completely sorted in an ascending order. This may cause a few complexity issues like what if the array needs no more swapping as all the elements are already ascending.</p>\n\n<p>To ease-out the issue, we use one flag variable <b>swapped</b> which will help us see if any swap has happened or not. If no swap has occurred, i.e. the array requires no more processing to be sorted, it will come out of the loop.</p>\n\n<p>Pseudocode of BubbleSort algorithm can be written as follows &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"pln\">procedure bubbleSort</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\"> list </span><span class=\"pun\">:</span><span class=\"pln\"> array of items </span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   loop </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">.</span><span class=\"pln\">count</span><span class=\"pun\">;</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">for</span><span class=\"pln\"> i </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0</span><span class=\"pln\"> to loop</span><span class=\"pun\">-</span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">do</span><span class=\"pun\">:</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      swapped </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">false</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\t\t\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">for</span><span class=\"pln\"> j </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0</span><span class=\"pln\"> to loop</span><span class=\"pun\">-</span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">do</span><span class=\"pun\">:</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      \n         </span><span class=\"com\">/* compare the adjacent elements */</span><span class=\"pln\">   \n         </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">j</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">j</span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">then</span><span class=\"pln\">\n            </span><span class=\"com\">/* swap them */</span><span class=\"pln\">\n            swap</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">j</span><span class=\"pun\">],</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span><span class=\"pun\">[</span><span class=\"pln\">j</span><span class=\"pun\">+</span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\">\t\t \n            swapped </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">true</span><span class=\"pln\">\n         </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\">\n         \n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">for</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      \n      </span><span class=\"com\">/*if no number was swapped that means \n      array is sorted now, break the loop.*/</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      \n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"kwd\">not</span><span class=\"pln\"> swapped</span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">then</span><span class=\"pln\">\n         </span><span class=\"kwd\">break</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      \n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">for</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   \n</span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> procedure </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> list</span></pre>\n\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n\n<p>One more issue we did not address in our original algorithm and its improvised pseudocode, is that, after every iteration the highest values settles down at the end of the array.

            "<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms Insertion Sort</h1>\n\n<p>This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted. For example, the lower part of an array is maintained to be sorted. An element which is to be &#39;insert&#39;ed in this sorted sub-list, has to find its appropriate place and then it has to be inserted there. Hence the name, <b>insertion sort</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of &Omicron;(n<sup>2</sup>), where <b>n</b> is the number of items.</p>\n\n<h2>How Insertion Sort Works?</h2>\n\n<p>We take an unsorted array for our example.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Unsorted Array\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/unsorted_array.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Insertion sort compares the first two elements.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Insertion Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/insertion_sort_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>It finds that both 14 and 33 are already in ascending order.

            "<h1>Data Structures - Merge Sort Algorithm</h1>\n\n<p>Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being &Omicron;(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.</p>\n\n<h2>How Merge Sort Works?</h2>\n\n<p>To understand merge sort, we take an unsorted array as the following &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Unsorted Array\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/unsorted_array.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We know that merge sort first divides the whole array iteratively into equal halves unless the atomic values are achieved. We see here that an array of 8 items is divided into two arrays of size 4.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Merge Sort Division\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/merge_sort_divide_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>This does not change the sequence of appearance of items in the original. Now we divide these two arrays into halves.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Merge Sort Division\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/merge_sort_divide_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We further divide these arrays and we achieve atomic value which can no more be divided.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Merge Sort Division\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/merge_sort_divide_3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now, we combine them in exactly the same manner as they were broken down. Please note the color codes given to these lists.</p>\n\n<p>We first compare the element for each list and then combine them into another list in a sorted manner. We see that 14 and 33 are in sorted positions. We compare 27 and 10 and in the target list of 2 values we put 10 first, followed by 27. We change the order of 19 and 35 whereas 42 and 44 are placed sequentially.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Merge Sort Combine\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/merge_sort_combine_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the combining phase, we compare lists of two data values, and merge them into a list of found data values placing all in a sorted order.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Merge Sort Combine\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/merge_sort_combine_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>After the final merging, the list should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Merge Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/merge_sort.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now we should learn some programming aspects of merge sorting.</p>\n\n<h3>Algorithm</h3>\n\n<p>Merge sort keeps on dividing the list into equal halves until it can no more be divided. By definition, if it is only one element in the list, it is sorted. Then, merge sort combines the smaller sorted lists keeping the new list sorted too.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<b>Step 1</b> &minus; if it is only one element in the list it is already sorted, return.\n<b>Step 2</b> &minus; divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no more be divided.\n<b>Step 3</b> &minus; merge the smaller lists into new list in sorted order.\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Pseudocode</h3>\n\n<p>We shall now see the pseudocodes for merge sort functions. As our algorithms point out two main functions &minus; divide &amp; merge.</p>\n\n<p>Merge sort works with recursion and we shall see our implementation in the same way.</p>\n\n<pre

            "<h1>Data Structure and Algorithms - Shell Sort</h1>\n\n<p>Shell sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on insertion sort algorithm. This algorithm avoids large shifts as in case of insertion sort, if the smaller value is to the far right and has to be moved to the far left.</p>\n\n<p>This algorithm uses insertion sort on a widely spread elements, first to sort them and then sorts the less widely spaced elements. This spacing is termed as <b>interval</b>. This interval is calculated based on Knuth&#39;s formula as &minus;</p>\n\n<h3>Knuth&#39;s Formula</h3>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nh = h * 3 + 1\nwhere &minus;\n   h is interval with initial value 1\n</pre>\n\n<p>This algorithm is quite efficient for medium-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity of this algorithm depends on the gap sequence the best known is &Omicron;(n), where n is the number of items. And the worst case space complexity is O(n).</p>\n\n<h2>How Shell Sort Works?</h2>\n\n<p>Let us consider the following example to have an idea of how shell sort works. We take the same array we have used in our previous examples. For our example and ease of understanding, we take the interval of 4. Make a virtual sub-list of all values located at the interval of 4 positions. Here these values are {35, 14}, {33, 19}, {42, 27} and {10, 44}</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Shell Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/shell_sort_gap_4.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We compare values in each sub-list and swap them (if necessary) in the original array. After this step, the new array should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Shell Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/shell_sort_step_1.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Then, we take interval of 1 and this gap generates two sub-lists - {14, 27, 35, 42}, {19, 10, 33, 44}</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Shell Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/shell_sort_gap_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We compare and swap the values, if required, in the original array. After this step, the array should look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Shell Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/shell_sort_step_2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Finally, we sort the rest of the array using interval of value 1. Shell sort uses insertion sort to sort the array.</p>\n\n<p>Following is the step-by-step depiction &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Shell Sort\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/shell_sort.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>We see that it required only four swaps to sort the rest of the array.</p>\n\n<h3>Algorithm</h3>\n\n<p>Following is the algorithm for shell sort.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Initialize the value of <i>h</i>\n<b>Step 2</b>

And recursively, we find the pivot for each sub-lists until all lists contains only one element.</p>\n\n<h2>Quick Sort Pivot Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>Based on our understanding of partitioning in quick sort, we will now try to write an algorithm for it, which is as follows.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Choose the highest index value has pivot\n<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot\n<b>Step 3</b> &minus; left points to the low index\n<b>Step 4</b> &minus; right points to the high\n<b>Step 5</b> &minus; while value at left is less than pivot move right\n<b>Step 6</b> &minus; while value at right is greater than pivot move left\n<b>Step 7</b> &minus; if both step 5 and step 6 does not match swap left and right\n<b>Step 8</b> &minus; if left &ge; right, the point where they met is new pivot\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Quick Sort Pivot Pseudocode</h2>\n\n<p>The pseudocode for the above algorithm can be derived as &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted\" style=\"\">\n<span class=\"kwd\">function</span><span class=\"pln\"> partitionFunc</span><span class=\"pun\">(</span><span class=\"pln\">left</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> right</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\"> pivot</span><span class=\"pun\">)</span><span class=\"pln\">\n   leftPointer </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> left\n   rightPointer </span><span class=\"pun\">=</span><span class=\"pln\"> right </span><span class=\"pun\">-</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">1</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">True</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">do</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\"> A</span><span class=\"pun\">[++</span><span class=\"pln\">leftPointer</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> pivot </span><span class=\"kwd\">do</span><span class=\"pln\">\n         </span><span class=\"com\">//do-nothing            </span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\t\t\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\"> rightPointer </span><span class=\"pun\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"lit\">0</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&amp;&amp;</span><span class=\"pln\"> A</span><span class=\"pun\">[--</span><span class=\"pln\">rightPointer</span><span class=\"pun\">]</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"pun\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pln\"> pivot </span><span class=\"kwd\">do</span><span class=\"pln\">\n         </span><span class=\"com\">//do-nothing         </span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\t\t\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\"> leftPointer </span><span class=\"pun\">&gt;=</span><span class=\"pln\"> rightPointer\n         </span><span class=\"kwd\">break</span><span class=\"pln\">\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">else</span><span class=\"pln\">                \n         swap leftPointer</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\">rightPointer\n      </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">if</span><span class=\"pln\">\n\t\t\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">while</span><span class=\"pln\"> \n\t\n   swap leftPointer</span><span class=\"pun\">,</span><span class=\"pln\">right\n   </span><span class=\"kwd\">return</span><span class=\"pln\"> leftPointer\n\t\n</span><span class=\"kwd\">end</span><span class=\"pln\"> </span><span class=\"kwd\">function</span></pre>\n\n<h2>Quick Sort Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>Using pivot algorithm recursively, we end up with smaller possible partitions.

It will then look like this &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Unbalanced BST\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/unbalanced_bst.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>It is observed that BST&#39;s worst-case performance is closest to linear search algorithms, that is &Omicron;(n). In real-time data, we cannot predict data pattern and their frequencies. So, a need arises to balance out the existing BST.</p>\n\n<p>Named after their inventor <b>Adelson</b>, <b>Velski</b> &amp; <b>Landis</b>, <b>AVL trees</b> are height balancing binary search tree. AVL tree checks the height of the left and the right sub-trees and assures that the difference is not more than 1. This difference is called the <b>Balance Factor</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Here we see that the first tree is balanced and the next two trees are not balanced &minus;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Unbalanced AVL Trees\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/unbalanced_avl_trees.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the second tree, the left subtree of <b>C</b> has height 2 and the right subtree has height 0, so the difference is 2. In the third tree, the right subtree of <b>A</b> has height 2 and the left is missing, so it is 0, and the difference is 2 again. AVL tree permits difference (balance factor) to be only 1.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<i><b>BalanceFactor</b></i> = height(left-sutree) &minus; height(right-sutree)\n</pre>\n\n<p>If the difference in the height of left and right sub-trees is more than 1, the tree is balanced using some rotation techniques.</p>\n\n<h2>AVL Rotations</h2>\n\n<p>To balance itself, an AVL tree may perform the following four kinds of rotations &minus;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"list\">\n\t<li>Left rotation</li>\n\t<li>Right rotation</li>\n\t<li>Left-Right rotation</li>\n\t<li>Right-Left rotation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first two rotations are single rotations and the next two rotations are double rotations. To have an unbalanced tree, we at least need a tree of height 2.

We perform the left rotation by making <b>A</b> the left-subtree of B.</p>\n\n<h2>Right Rotation</h2>\n\n<p>AVL tree may become unbalanced, if a node is inserted in the left subtree of the left subtree. The tree then needs a right rotation.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Right Rotation\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/avl_right_rotation.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>As depicted, the unbalanced node becomes the right child of its left child by performing a right rotation.</p>\n\n<h3>Left-Right Rotation</h3>\n\n<p>Double rotations are slightly complex version of already explained versions of rotations. To understand them better, we should take note of each action performed while rotation. Let&#39;s first check how to perform Left-Right rotation.

Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected..</p>\n\n<p>By this definition, we can draw a conclusion that every connected and undirected Graph G has at least one spanning tree.

Based on this criteria, a heap can be of two types &minus;</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\nFor Input &rarr; 35 33 42 10 14 19 27 44 26 31\n</pre>\n\n<p><b>Min-Heap</b> &minus; Where the value of the root node is less than or equal to either of its children.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Max Heap Example\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/min_heap_example.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><b>Max-Heap</b> &minus; Where the value of the root node is greater than or equal to either of its children.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Max Heap Example\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/max_heap_example.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Both trees are constructed using the same input and order of arrival.</p>\n\n<h2>Max Heap Construction Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>We shall use the same example to demonstrate how a Max Heap is created. The procedure to create Min Heap is similar but we go for min values instead of max values.</p>\n\n<p>We are going to derive an algorithm for max heap by inserting one element at a time. At any point of time, heap must maintain its property. While insertion, we also assume that we are inserting a node in an already heapified tree.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Create a new node at the end of heap.\n<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Assign new value to the node.\n<b>Step 3</b> &minus; Compare the value of this child node with its parent.\n<b>Step 4</b> &minus; If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.\n<b>Step 5</b> &minus; Repeat step 3 &amp; 4 until Heap property holds.\n</pre>\n\n<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In Min Heap construction algorithm, we expect the value of the parent node to be less than that of the child node.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s understand Max Heap construction by an animated illustration. We consider the same input sample that we used earlier.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Max Heap Animated Example\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/max_heap_animation.gif\" /></p>\n\n<h2>Max Heap Deletion Algorithm</h2>\n\n<p>Let us derive an algorithm to delete from max heap. Deletion in Max (or Min) Heap always happens at the root to remove the Maximum (or minimum) value.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"result notranslate\">\n<b>Step 1</b> &minus; Remove root node.\n<b>Step 2</b> &minus; Move the last element of last level to root.\n<b>Step 3</b> &minus; Compare the value of this child node with its parent.\n<b>Step 4</b> &minus; If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.\n<b>Step 5</b> &minus; Repeat step 3 &amp; 4 until Heap property holds.\n</pre>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Max Heap Deletion Animated Example\" src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/max_heap_deletion_animation.gif\" /></p>\n"
